a	O

I	O
did	O
a	O

I	O
installed	O

you	O

I	O
am	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
replacement	O

I	O
am	O
worried	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
choose	O
the	O
wrong	O
GPU	U-hard
so	O
my	O
Power	B-hard
Supply	L-hard
wo	O
n't	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
handle	O
it	O
.	O
These	O
are	O
GPUs	U-hard
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
buy	O

.	O
So	O
from	O
these	O
tests	O
I	O
fugured	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
probably	O
go	O
with	O
even	O
better	O
GPUs	U-hard
for	O
this	O
current	O
Power	B-hard
Supply	L-hard
I	O
got	O

The	O
GTX	B-hard
1060	L-hard
I	O
looked	O
up	O
was	O
mini	O
version	O
by	O
ZOTAC	U-org
,	O
it	O
says	O
on	O
some	O
websites	O
I	O
looked	O
up	O
that	O
it	O
s	O
TDP	U-hard
was	O
around	O
130W	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
worried	O
.	O
This	O
version	O
you	O
tested	O
is	O
probably	O
better	O
option	O
than	O
this	O
one	O
,	O
so	O
if	O
it	O
can	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
my	O
current	O
PSU	U-hard
I	O
would	O
deffinitely	O
consider	O
it	O

I	O
plan	O
to	O
upgrade	O
my	O

to	O
i7	B-hard
4790	L-hard
and	O
buy	O

also	O

so	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
some	O

now	O

This	O

did	O
well	O

there	O
s	O

a	O

it	O
