At its founding , Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices 
The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market , widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory 
Its first product , a quick entry into the small , high-speed memory market in 1969 , was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory ( SRAM ) , which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba , Japan 
In the same year , Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory ( ROM ) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) silicon gate SRAM chip , the 256-bit 1101 
While the 1101 was a significant advance , its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories 
The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , the 1103 released in 1970 solved these issues 
The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972 , as it replaced core memory in many applications 
Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products , still dominated by various memory devices 
Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor ( Intel 4004 ) in 1971 
The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry , as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer , which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do 
Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in 1973 
Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972 , in Malaysia , which would host multiple Intel operations , before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s , and manufacturing and development centres in China , India and Costa Rica in the 1990s 
By the early 1980s , its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) chips 
However , increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had , by 1983 , dramatically reduced the profitability of this market 
The growing success of the IBM personal computer , based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore ( CEO since 1975 ) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model 
Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success 
By the end of the 1980s , buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market , Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary ( and most profitable ) hardware supplier to the PC industry , part of the winning Wintel' combination 
Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987 
By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991 , Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection , so that by the end of the 1990s , its line of Pentium processors had become a household name 
In 2010 , Intel purchased McAfee , a manufacturer of computer security technology , for $7.68 billion 
As a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction , Intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel chips and personal computers 
After the acquisition , Intel had about 90 employees , including about 12 software engineers 
In September 2016 , Intel sold a majority stake in its computer-security unit to TPG Capital , reversing the five-year-old McAfee acquisition 
In August 2010 , Intel and Infineon Technologies announced that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business

The Dutch PCM ( Personal Computer Magazine ) did a test in their April 2011 issue 
They took an image of one of their editorial PC s , which was one and a half years old and never optimized 
They compared a manual cleaning , using only standard Windows tools , with the results of a set of 9 tools by measuring startup time , shutdown time and speed according during the PCMark Vantage test 
The results summarized below are interesting 
They showed that some products actually slowed the system or increased the startup time 
One program ( see table below ) even manages to increase both the startup and the shutdown time and slowing the system at the same time 
On the positive site : they reported no problems with the system after running these tools 
After having some problems accessing shares across the platforms , I ve found that Acronis products as well as others can be at the root 
The cure seems to be something about increasing the IRPStackSize 
I ve Image 9 on one ( XP ) and 10 on another ( Win7 ) and receiving errors accessing XP shares from the Win7 machine until stumbling into this fix 
A google search will quickly find the regedit way to correct for this 
For me the size needed to be at least decimal 21 
Hope that helps someone out there 
I think you may be wrong with regard to the Speed test + 1.6 % surely means that it is quicker , otherwise System Mechanic would not have been given a best rating for + 3.6 % and PC Tools worst for - 3.1 % 
I love CCleaner 
I recommend it to all of my friends / family ( and by recommend I mean I install it on their machines and clean up without telling them ) 
However , a friend of mine is blind and it appears that JAWS ( 508 Compliance screen reader ) does not see all the objects in CCLeaner 
Can anyone recommend a FREE cleanup utility that JAWS will work with ? Also , once in a while a member will be very upset no one has a fix or alternate 
That s normal as it was noted in this area it breaks a YouTube agreement plus Google keeps changing how YouTube works so that app would need constant attention to keep working 
Greetings from the UK ! Whenever I open Microsoft Word , which I have as Word 365 , I almost always get a litany of error messages telling me that Word is unable to open various converters 
The programs listed include Excel , Lotus , Works , etc 
Which computer are you using ? Exact make and model , please 
If it s custom built which motherboard does it have ? Which operating system are you using ? Windows 10 Home ? Or Pro ? Windows 8.1 Home or Pro ? I have done the Chkdsk process ; one error was found and repaired , but Word is no better 
The only difference is that Adobe Reader DC stopped working and I had to restart to delete it from my system 
Samsung - PC ( Touch screen ) processor Intel i%-3470 T @2.90GHz RAM 6.00 GB 64-bit operating system , x64 based processor Windows 10 Home , Version 1903 
Addendum to earlier comment : I am using a MacPro , with the latest operating system always up to date 
The error messages claim to be looking for files in directories that do n't exist 
( Even the Microsoft techies could not find them anywhere on my computer 
) I suspect that this has something to do with the macros that I have written for these spreadsheets , but can not find anything in those macros that confirm that suspicion 
Are you referring to # 20 : Sabrent M.2 SSD to 2.5-Inch SATA III Aluminum Enclosure Adapter ( EC - M2SA ) ? Will go ahead with the UGREEN then just purchased now 
The Apricon was a bit expensive 
Look like the software is the main price here I think ? Works out cheaper for me if I move my data to external matching HDD to SSD 
Then Clone it , then replace HDD with new SDD 
Shortly after will copying the data to the new HDD 
Cool , problem solved well only that by matching the HDD and SSD using any of the cloning software 
Hmm do n't want to get my hopes until it actually clone first ? I am missing something ? The Macrium or MiniTools are saying too small to clone for my 240 gb SSD 
Are you saying the Apricon removes those restrictions and clone whether big or small e.g Cloning 500 gb HDD to 240 gb SSD ? Not sure what you are implying ? I m almost done with my data transfer so I hope it works 
When I select the SIGNATURES button in Outlook 2016 , nothing happens 
i ve tried numerous solutions such as checking if I have Office 365 apps installed ( I did n't ) and quick and full Office repair 
Did n't work 
Any ideas ? Create a new user account then log into that ( Windows User accounts , use and more are in many articles 
) Test and see if it s a system wide issue 
Can I send mt photos from my iPhone to my PC with shareit ? Open your iPhone s Photos app 
Choose the album containing the photos you want to send 
Tap the button in the upper righthand corner that looks like a rectangle with an arrow coming out of it 
Tap the photos you want to send 
Tap the action you want to take from the bar at the bottom 
Let s say there is " software out there that will automatically go online , search google for my website and click on website , then navigate web site so that google will start to notice me ? " I want you to google about SEO FORUMS ( use those two words ) and there is a plethora of forums and information available 
I m going to contain my reply to this sort of software and write it s a dead end 
The searches created by same would not be " organic " and Google may actually PENALIZE you for trying such a stunt 
if I enter it directly I have no problems , if I google " whitegass " google does n't even notice me , and of course forget about keywords 
right now I am making money but I have to pay for advertising 
I really would like to find some way to get organic hits from google 
So let me ask three simple questions : 1 
What do you want to do ( like : update Flash for Firefox ) ? 2 
How do you try to do it ( like : going to what site and clicking what ? 3 
What happens ( like : AVG gives the following message } : ... ) ? And 2 more : 4 
Why reinstall this version of Flash ? Reinstalling means you installed it already 
Or did you mean  update  ? 5 
The current version of Flash is 32.0.0.371 

Why do you want to reinstall an old version ? m planning to build my second rig this coming September and the cpu and mobo I picked is the ryzen 7 2700 paired with a b450 msi titanium 
I m also gon na try to pair it with a 8x2 3000 - 3200 mhz kit for optimal performance 
I already have a spare case , 650w psu , and an sapphire rx 590 to complete the build 
I m gon na do an all white build so I m gon na spray paint all the pcb frames and chassis white hehe 
So is the ryzen 7 2700 worth it in the long shot ? I want it to last 5 years at most because I do n't wanna waste money upgrading new parts 
I plan to oc it and run full turbo all the time 
I usually play 3ple A titles and 1080p games at high - ultra settings 
So , physically , my motherboard has 4 sata ports ( Dell optiplex 3010 MT , paired with an i5 - 3570 ) 
I want to add a third drive but when I try to enable the port in the bios , only sata-0 and 1 show up , which I m currently using 
Sata 3/4 do not show up at all in the bios 
Yes , I made sure to check if the third drive is actually being powered and its sata cable works 
The mother board is also the SLJ4B chipset in case anyone was going to mention something about that 
I ve also updated the Bios to A22 , the most recent update 
Please do n't tell me to go into disk management or something , as that is n't the issue 
Someone might say something about enabling the ports in the bios , but as I stated before , I can NOT do that as it does NOT show up 
You say that SATA ports never show in the bios but SATA-0 and SATA-1 do show up . I searched the issue on the dell forums and someone has the same problem once before but I neglected to go to the second page 
It appears that I might need the original optiplex front panel connectors 
This is a legacy design to accommodate older OSes like XP that did n't at the time have SATA support so you would flip the BIOS to ATA or Legacy ( varies with maker s choice what words they use ) and all too often you would end up with just two operational ports 
PS 
I must mention that if you change the mode from ATA to SATA you can find some OSes fail to boot 
DO NOT REPAIR THAT FAILED OS as the change can cause the repair to irreversibly damage what s on those drives 
Just put the mode back and get ready for backups if need be plus a new clean install with the BIOS in the SATA mode of choice 
apparently for the mobo to recognize the other two ports I needed a jumper on 3 of the pins in the 16 pin thing on the board 
I jury - rigged a 3-way jumper thing and now all 4 ports are recognized I ’m planning to buy a laptop with a Core i5 - 1035G1 Processor and shared graphics 
I ’m also thinking of playing Ori and the Will of the Wisps , which requires at minimum an Nvidia GTX 950 or AMD R7 370 graphics card 
I ’m having a hard time finding a comparison between either of those graphics cards and that particular model of Intel UHD graphics 
The graphics cards both came out in 2015 , and the CPU came out in 2019 
Is four years enough time for shared graphics to catch up with a decent graphics card ? My minimum gamer laptop specs : i5 , 1050 Ti ( mobile ) , 8 GB RAM in dual channel mode and SSD for storage of 240 or more GB 
Why the 1050 Ti mobile ? Because it s close enough to the desktop GTX 950 
Hello everyone , About a month ago , I bought a new laptop HP Pavilion Gaming ( 15-dk0026na ) , and in the same day I ve decided to upgrade it to 32 gb RAM 
Of course , I opened it and I ve noticed nothing strange though 
About now , a month later , I ve decided to add an SSD , so when I ve opened again , I notice a strange spot on the plastic covering GPU ( ? ) or CPU ( ? ) unsure of it , as it is going to melt 
I never had a problem with overheating , and whilst playing games , it warms up but never overheats , nor I got any unexpected shutdown or BSOD 
Temperature sensors are not helping at all , as I ve checked the temperatures and they are fluctuating every second + /- 20 degrees celsius ( e.g. now 60*C , next second 85*C , next second 70*C , then 55 , then again 80 etc 
) I m building a Rig for VR and video editing 
I will push it but I will keep it stock 
No overclocling 
Can I run it on the included fan or do I need Water cooling ? If you recommend anything I want stand alone and simple 
I m already over budget but I want no overheating 
Also will this set run Red Dead 2 And Half Life Alxy Good in VR ? AMD Ryzen 9 3900x / Gigabyte X570 Aorus Ultra , G.Skill Trident 32Gb 3600MHz / Seagate Firecuda 520 2 TB NVMe , Gigabyte RTX 2070 Super Gaming OC 8 GB , Oculus Quest Headset 
Hi , I ve recently installed a Core Frozr S on my Z270 sli Plus motherboard to cool an i7 - 7700k after 5 days I ve noticed that the thermal paste is dripped from the cpu on the motherboard for about 10 cm down the cpu 
Could that damage my motherboard since it s dripping for few days and what s the solution pleaase ! ! ! I do n't see how you can get into say , Windows gaming at that price since the OS alone in 100 dollars 
There are no gaming PCs that you can build for that little unless you are well , you tell us what 200 dollar PC you found 
i want to be able to play games like cod , fortnite , stuff like that 
the dell optiplex other boards are under 50 and mainly have LGA 1155 sockets so i got ta find compatible cpus for that 
i know ram and graphics cards are a bit expensive so i m thinking extending the budget to 250 maybe 300 
i plan to use ssd maybe 500 gb 
I just want a pc that can do basic stuff and play games with maybe 40 - 50 frames on low graphics settings 
Again i am not a serious gamer , just wanting to play a couple video games 
That said the gamers I know start with some minimums 
Here s what I think folk should try as a start for Windows gaming 
1 
Windows 10 
Older versions are losing support from not only Microsoft but the game makers 
2 
Almost any i5 at the 2500 or newer models 
3 
A great Graphics Card 
My nod is to the Nvidia 1050 Ti or better 
Even used I see these for $ 125 so that s a huge chunk of the budget 
4 
A 1080p 60Hz or such monitor or HDTV 
Watch out for " input lag " on those TVs 
Good used monitors are a big chunk of your 200 buck budget 
5 
8 GB RAM in dual channel mode 
6 
The biggest SSD ( solid state drive ) you can afford 
500 GB is at times near 60USD and never would be an used drive 
So there is a difference in screensize also 
1920 pixels with 103 pixels per inch gives 18.6 inch and 2560 pixels with 123 pixels per inch gives 20.8 inch for the width 
That s bigger 
But a x pixel character is smaller , so you might prefer other settings for zoom in your browser and for scaling in Windows 
You re right , 23.8 for Lenovo versus 24.1 for Dell 
I d love to see them side - by - side but I ca n't do that as I m 90-minutes away from a Staples or BestBuy 
Is the difference in PPI , 103 versus 123 a noticeable difference ? I decided against the Lenovo because of the glossy screen and disappointed in the 94 PPI for the 2415 so spent $ 40 more for the Dell - P2421D 
It s 123 PPI , see specs 
Hi , I m on Windows 10 , and this is a new issue that s popped up in the past few days 
I have two external hard drive disks - previously , when I deleted files , they would send them to the recycle bin 
Now though , they no longer do so , and only ask me if I want to get rid of them permanently , like on a USB stick 
This is an issue because if I ever accidentally delete a file , I want to be able to recover it immediately 
This could have to do with the fact that one of my hard drives fell down lightly the other day ( though it is strange , because they re otherwise working perfectly fine , and this also affects the one that did n't fall ) 
When I click on the Recycle Bin properties , its only location is my internal C : drive - I assume it s supposed to have the other drives as well ? Is there a way to add them back ? I ve tried unplugging and plugging them back in , to no avail 
As I understand it , each external HDD has a specific hidden " recycle bin " that is linked to the desktop recycle bin 
Both of them still had these , though I deleted one , to see if that changed anything , because I thought I read that if I unplugged and plugged the HDD back in it would recreate it ( which , uh , it did n't ) 
I tried chkdsk and scannow on one of the drives , but not both of them 
Since both are exhibiting the same behavior , I m mostly making tests on the one containing less data 
So now I m kinda stumped 
I have no idea if there s a way to fix this , and searching online gave me no real clue - most posts are about deleting the external HDD recycle bins , which obviously is not what I want 
I m in the process of buying upgrades for my h9 - 1460ea gaming PC , and I ve sorted my RAM upgrades so it s utilising the maximum 32 GB rather than the original 6 GB 
I d appreciate some guidance on upgrading the graphics card and SSD ; it still has the GTX 660 it came with , but I m not particularly knowledgeable about GPUs 
I ve heard the GTX 1060 is a good upgrade for it and fits the case etc 
, but I ve noticed its power requirements are 400W and my PC runs on 600W ; does this make a difference , and therefore will I also need a new power supply ? And in terms of the SSD , it still has the original 128 GB SSD , but I plan on also upgrading this to at least a 500 GB or 1 TB upgrade from Crucial , but I m unsure if there s anything else I need to account for 
I went through a very old Quad Core desktop and in the end used the GTX 1060 
Please read https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/im-upgrading-some-old-iron-what-would-you-like/ where I took it step by step PLUS used a Watt meter at each step to see if I was overtaxing the rather small power supply 
In short , if your power supply is a single rail of either 400 or 600 Watts it will be fine 
If you want me to check out the PSU about it being single rail just supply the make and model number and hopefully I can find the specs 
If not post a picture on say Imgur.com of the specs on the PSU side panel for me to look at 
Currently I ca n't look at the power supply of the PC as it s at home ( I m a student just graduating from uni ; will be back at home around the 20th of June ) 
I ve checked on the HP site for PC specs but they only specify the type of power supply it is instead of the model / make i.e. Internal ATX form factor , Total wattage : 600W , Nominal input voltage range : 100 - 127V ( 50 - 60Hz)/200 - 240V ( 50 - 60Hz ) , 2 PCI - E Power Connectors 
Just opened up the casing , for some reason I ca n't link a photo of the PSU but the model number is : DPS-600WBA 
I also looked into the physical dimensions of the GTX 1060 and I can just about physically fit it into the case 
Thanks again for any advice ! I just checked System Information on my PC and it does say that my BIOS mode is UEFI ; does that mean I can actually use a better graphics card like the 1660 Bob__B suggested ? The price of the GTX 1060 is higher than the 1660 , but there are some differences ; the 1060 is a 6 pin connection to the PSU while the 1660 is 8 pin , and there are also several variations of the 1660 i.e. GTX 1660 ti , GTX 1660 super , ASUS GTX 1660 etc 
Very confusing to know which one is best to go for at this point , but that being said the standard 1660 seems remarkably smaller physically than the 1060 - considering the h9 - 1460ea case is relatively small , it would be preferable to save as much space whilst getting the best possible option simultaneously 
I see various answers to the 6-pin and 8-pin dilemma , but if my PSU already has an 8-pin connector installed with the GTX 660 it came with should I not stick with that in case I get a 6-pin and it does n't function properly ? Like I said previously , I have little to no knowledge about PC components , so many of the google links you provided that discuss it talk about the voltage and ground parts of the cables from the PSU to the graphics card - all of which goes straight over my head and does n't actually help me narrow it down as all the answers seems to differ 
I have a 2017 iMac running High Sierra and my Magic Mouse 2 ( lithium - ion battery charged via Lightning plug ) bought at the same time no longer connects 
When I click on the " Connect " button , the display shows " Connected " and immediately switches to " Not connected " 
Nothing I do has fixed this 
Have a stock of blank CDs but have forgotten how to record on them 
They are imation brand , CD - R , 700m/80 min 
Compatible with all drives from 1x to 52x 
Can somebody tell me where to start ? My computer details : macOS High Sierra , version 10.13.6 , iMac , Retina 4K. 
Processor 3,1 GHz Intel Core i5 , Memory 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 
The amount of memory depends on the size of the data and how much space is used for calculations 
100 million rows of 100 bytes are just 10 GB 
That would leave 118 GB for OS , program and work space 
Might be more than needed 
Here also , ask the maker for advice and run a benchmark comparing , say , 32 , 64 and 128 GB 
I m going to skip any mention of PRAM resets and keys you hold down during power up or your Apple 
To be an owner of a legacy product I think you would have those burned into long term memory or a cheat sheet 
the replacement of the optical drive in any of the G4 laptops is certainly not for the faint of heart 
I presume that the computer would n't boot statement refers to you trying to boot the computer from the optical drive using a Mac OSX Installation disk 
If that is not the case , and your computer does not boot at all , there is a 99 % chance that it has gone to join the choir invisible 
shuffled off this mortal coil , bereft of life , gone to meet its maker ( aplogies to Monty P ) Step 17 of the ifixit procedure carries a dire warning 
With 20/20 hindsight , perhaps a better fix for the problem on this ageing laptop , between 13 and 18 years old , would have been a Firewire Optical drive or even a USB one 
to be honest , I think you are attached to another object by an inclined plane , wrapped helically around an axis 
I recently just bought an iMac G5 20 ” , 1 GB , 250 GB Mid 2005 model ( I think ) from a flee market 
I knew it was defective , but thought that I could fix it or use it as decoration at worst 
The iMac has graphical errors at boot up , but the OS system loads fine 
Everything in the background works even the DVD ( tested with a DVD film ) 
Sound works and it seems just fine , but the screen is all screwed up with checkerboards and graphical errors all over the place 
I can not read what is stated on the screen

) Is there a way , to get it running again as an iTunes server ? ( I use a Mid-2011 iMac , running the current MacOS Sierra 10.12.2003 , and the latest version of iTunes 12.5.5.5 ) 2 
) If it can not be used for iTunes any more , what other useful stuff can I install on it ? 3 
) Does it worth upgrading it in any way ( I mean with an SSD drive , etc 
) ? I do have a 4th Gen. Apple TV for the living room 
Of course the output is not HD but it is close enough , through upscaling , as to make no never mind 
I swapped out the standard HD for a larger one , 160 GB , ( hey - it was big at the time ) and have had no problems with either it or the ATV itself 
I ran ATV Flash on it to jailbreak it which gave it more functionality but it still appears in iTunes ( 12.5.5.5 ) and plays AVI / MP4 / MKV and a couple more I can not remember . I just found 2 older ATV 1 gens that I forgot I had 
I was able to install OSMC and run Kodi 
Not bad performance 
I m using an older 720p TV so pic quality is as good as it can get on the TV 
I had to use the ATV with a wired connection - not sure if it can run on wireless network 
There are some upgrades that can be done for better performance ( HD Crystal card ) and larger HD , but I figure by the time I invest more $ $ into this I could have bought a new Android / Kodi box for the same cost 
I have tried several possibilities 
I created a Sierra OS external drive and downgraded to iTunes 12.6.3.6 
Tried to replace the " iTunes Library.itl " file from my current High Sierra iTunes 12.7.x in the iTunes 12.6.x folder but of course I got an error message that it was n't compatible with an earlier version , so ... I tried the Export Playlist / Import Playlist method ( Export Playlist from my current Mac OS and Import Playlist on my iTunes 12.6.x ) and was able to get all of my current iTunes media on to my iTunes 12.6.x 
The only thing that seems to be different is the Apple TV icon at the top of the iTunes menu is missing , but clicking on my iPhone / iPad icon dropped down a menu with iPhone , iPad AND Apple TV 
Now I can connect to my ATV1 , but still having problems with uploading photos and creating Screen Saver , etc 
Home Sharing does work though 
My next step is going to try downgrading iTunes 12.6.3.6 to 12.6.2002 and see if that helps 
was their hardware and their support was n't as good as Dell 
The XPS line of Dell is good but Lenovo seem to have better quality in the low price end 
Well , I think that Apple is the best laptop brand 
The laptops from this brand are really good to work on and are very smooth 
But the cost of Apple laptops is on a higher side 
In case , the budget is an issue then go with Dell 
The brand manufactures durable and robust laptop with latest features They were not previously also 
This year apple promised unbeliveble productivity with intel i9 , but after a some time the prodoctivity was falling ( trotling ) because of owerheating 
So , no sense to pay extra 
Nowadays only big fans of this brend are buying their products 
And about previous years 
They were 1st because of statistic 
For example from 100 laptops was sold 20 apple , 19 ASUS , 11 Lenovo , 19 Dell , 18 Microsoft and 12 MSI 
It shows that 80 % with Windows was sold and 20 % with macOS

I ve got an hp notebook 17-x115dx 
The images devices is not showing up on my Device Manager on Windows 10 
Apparently , my webcam is not showing up 
All of my updates including BIOS is downloaded including Windows 10 are already installed 
I did scan hardware changes and nothing happens 
I ve used the HP Support and went on their website to look for the drivers and i can not find anything 
Can anyone send me a direct link where I can download the right drivers for the built in camera , thanks 
Hi I ’ve bought Lenovo s540GTX series recently 
I have problem with its USB - A ( 3.1VER ) ports 
When I connect my WD Element external drive to any of them , it takes a while more than usual to recognize the drive 
Moreover , it s transferring speed is below 40 MB / s 
Also , when the drive is connected , my Internet connection will stop working 
I did n’t have these problems with another drives 
It would be better to say this , I thought that It might my external drive has problem but I tested it on Asus UX501vw Laptop and it worked properly 
So , anyone has any idea what should I do ! ? which is more of an example is a motherboard ( I ca n't be sure if it s the right one for yours ) which costs just under 60 USD so that s a deal since the shop counter charge here starts at 150 USD plus parts 
Hello everyone , I am looking for a new battery for my Yuanpeng YEPO 737S , the part number is H-3885265P , my previous battery capacity is 8000MAH , I am preparing to buy it online , and seeing that it is 10000MAH online , different capacity will affect Use it ? This is my first discussion here and I wanted to ask which one of these two laptops are better for college and mediocere gaming use : FX531GT - BQ400 T ( i7 - 9750 , fhd 15.6 , 16 gb ddr4 ram , 512 ssd m.2 , gtx 1650 ) 
FX505GM - AL340 T ( i7 - 9750 , fhd 15.6 , 8 gb ddr4 2666 ram , SSD 128Gb + HDD 1Tb , gtx 1060 ) 
The Asus TUF FX505GM has a more powerful gtx 1060 vs the Asus Rog FX531GT that has gtx 1650 but the Asus Rog will last longer 
As the Asus Rog has a more robust chassis and it looks better too 
I use bog standard 2.5 laptop size SSDs 
Now once in a while you ll have a client that demands a compatibility check 
For them you go to Crucial.com for both RAM and SSD 
Otherwise you can shop from an abundant selection of SATA 2.5 inch laptop drives 
I have an Acer Aspire A515 - 51 G and I want some opinions before I upgrade my RAM 
Right now the laptop has 8 GB ( 4 GB soldered on motherboard and 4 GB switchable ) 
I m thinking of removing the 4 GB and placing a 16 GB , in order to have 20 GB ( which is the maximum supported for this motherboard ) 
Current RAM run at 2133Hz with CAS 15 and runs at Dual Channel 
My two final options are Corsair and G.Skill 
I wonder if my question is off topic or a stupid question 
I am very unfamiliar with the digital devices but now I have to buy and use those for my school 
I would like to do on line teaching live streaming using zoom or something like that 
If I buy a smart tv and connect it with laptop , then can I use the smart tv as my laptop ? What I want to do is using tv as my whiteboard ( on tv , my powerpoint lessons stored in my laptop will be shown ) 
As usual I will be standing beside the tv 
I would like the students to see me&tv together as they saw me in the face - to - face traditional classroom 
I was wondering if anyone out there could help me out 
I m looking for the drivers for an HDR - FX7 Mini DV camera 
I m using Windows 10 and Vegas 16 Pro 
It had worked in the past but the Device Manager did not see the camera , my firewire card is working 
I downloaded the FAM drivers off of the Sony site and it now sees the camera but there are no drivers available to operate the camera so I can move the video from the camera to the computer for processing 
Any ideas would be welcome 
I have a Panasonic Palmcorder PV - IQ403 that I want to take on vacation soon 
The recording seems fine , it s just the VCR function 
It s a very odd problem that wo n't seem to go away 
Whenever I play back video , the speed of playback switches from " SP " mode to " SLP " mode every 3 to 5 seconds 
This causes the video to go from slightly sped - up at times to downright headache inducing 
I do n't believe it s the tapes fault , but I could be wrong 
Seeing as how this is the only VCR I own ( and the only one within 3000 miles that takes VHS - C ) , I want this thing working 
I m on a mission to convert all my family s old videos from our tapes to digital so they re better safeguarded 
I started this project with a camcorder we already had to convert VHS - c tapes using Honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 software and that worked perfectly 
I just purchased a used Sharp Viewcam VL - E620u and am trying to convert my 8 mm tapes , but I m having a problem where the video looks fine when you view it from the camcorder itself , but when I try to convert it using my Honestech program the video goes black and white 
I m hoping for any tips , as I m completely lost and am so frustrated 
Thank you in advance ! What I m Using : Sharp Viewcam VL - E620u Laptop with Windows 10 The converter that came with the Honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 program Cable that came with camcorder , it has a yellow and white plug on one end and a single black plug on the other that plugs into the camcorder 
The battery that s in the camcorder is a power charger adapter where it plugs into the wall outlet 
I read this in a similar model by that maker : " This product incorporates copyright protection technology that is protected by method claims of certain U.S. patents and other intellectual property rights owned by Macrovision Corporation and other rights owners 
" I have avoided this by using a DVR or a VHS recorder 
My favorite tool in digitizing is not a PC 
it s this thing 
But remember that in your case it s never the same thing so I admit I ll try this , that and something else till it works 
Again , if you have but one digitizer then eventually it wo n't do the job 
Does anyone have a battery for a Panasonic PV - GS29 mini camcorder ? Check with the User Manual 
I think the battery is the CGR - DU06 which is still available 
The company has done some revelations about the technology that has been integrated

Currently Apex Legends released 
This game looks really good , i charged keys from to plays a few days when I get back from school 
Apex save the world all i play now .. Similar fornite the number one game , Fortnite is too sweaty these days , it s hard to actually enjoy the game anymore 
Apex legends is the best thing that could ve happened to fortnite 
Epic might finally have some competition and that could encourage them to improve their game 
They need to add seasons and battle pass like in fortnite ASAP or a lot of people will go back to fortnite 
New season soon so it d be good if they d add it either this month or wait until season 8 fortnite cools down 
both games are my favorite games but I think apex legends better then fortine because of it graphics apex legends graphics much better than fortine , both games are battel royal games , however , fortine not a better than apex legends there are many battel royal games available and pubg is more popular than fortine and apex legends 
apex legends were released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 4 , 2019 , and fortine released for PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch , Android , Xbox One , iOS , Microsoft Windows , Macintosh operating systems in 2017 
Fortnite is a very popular game of 2017 - 2018 and developed by Epic Games , epic games are very popular gaming company which have launched more than thouasand games 
And Flash memory the answer to " can anyone " has to be yes 
While there may be a handful of folk that can get in that deep the real issue is what s in that cloud which is more likely to leak than a factory reset console with the HDD you used 
I m going to just say it since it will take too long to write this softly 
If you feel this is what is needed , then do it but I consider it foolish to remove the HDD given all the other means of data access 
AGAIN , do the factory resets and drive clearing 
Then move on 
Picture settings tested : CNET is no longer publishing advanced picture settings for any TVs we review 
Instead , we ll give more general recommendations to get the best picture without listing the detailed white balance or color management system ( CMS ) settings we may have used to calibrate the TV 
As always , the settings provided are a guidepost , and if you want the most accurate picture you should get a professional calibration 
Before calibration the Cinema and preset was the most accurate , excellent in terms of grayscale and gamma with just a slight reddish cast toward brighter areas ( but still within my error target of delta 3 ) 
Since I now target a 2.2 gamma for my reviews dark rooms it was closer than ISF Expert Dark or the new Filmmaker modes , which both target gamma 2.4 / BT 1886 
ISF Bright was basically identical to Cinema but I reserved that for brighter rooms 
For my calibration I tweaked the two - point grayscale to remove the red cast , reduced light output to my target of 137 nits and increased brightness two pips to help with shadow detail ( while still keeping perfect black levels ) but otherwise left well enough alone 
The grayscale and color were already so accurate on my LG - provided review sample that I did n't need to touch the multipoint system or the color management system 
SDR dark room settings : Picture Mode Settings : Cinema , Aspect Ratio Settings : 16:9 ( Just Scan : On ) , Energy Saving : Off 
HDR Notes : HDR Cinema and Filmmaker mode were basically identical , following the EOTF quite closely and better than both Cinema Home 
Color checker was a bit less - accurate than on the C9 from last year but not bad , and as usual with OLED the set covered P3 HDR gamut very well 
The CX also measured dimmer than the C9 , coming closer in peak brightness ( both accurate and inaccurate settings ) to the B9 
Once again the TV automatically detected and engaged the " HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color " setting designed for HDR sources 
I m curious why CNET opted to stop posting the details of the calibration settings ? These were tremendously useful ! I have 3 TV s in my house right now that date back more than 15 years , and I have all 3 CNET postings which give the detailed specs bookmarked and always available on a web page in my phone 
No joke 
Please re - evaluate that decision ! We love you and your calibration setting , katz ! Thanks for the note , and the love , and trust me when I say removing the advanced calibration settings -- namely specific numbers for color temperature ( white balance ) and CMS ( color management system ) -- was n't an easy decision 
I did it because in many TVs they might do more harm than good 
Over the last few years TVs  default CT and CMS settings in the best modes are very good , and any tweaking via those advanced menus is dependent in large part on the individual TV 
In my case , that means a TV that was probably provided to me by a TV manufacturer , hand - picked for image quality and perhaps even pre - adjusted for maximum accuracy 
Any tweaks I do to those deeper settings on my review sample will likely be different from the tweaks required for the deeper settings on your TV 
My TV reviews today continue to include lots of more - basic settings , including picture modes , numbers for settings like backlight and contrast , as well as motion settings , gamma and color temperature / CMS modes 
The only change has been to stop posting those deeper CT / CMS numbers 
Sorry if you miss them but for the reasons listed above , I do n't plan to start posting them again anytime soon 
I am trying to set up a video wall with 2x2 LG 47 " flat screens , each with 2 K resolution , in order to have one 4 K display distributed on all four screens 
I am using the AMD Radeon RX570 graphics adapter with support for up to 5 screens 
All screens are connected properly ( one with native HDMI the other three with Display port - HDMI adapters ) 
All screens are working properly and shows parts of the windows image 
Eyefinity is activated , but for some reason I may only arrange the screens as four screens side by side , but not as a 2x2 matrix 
I am running Windows 10 and the standard dialog for screen rearrangement does not allow me to move the screen symbols to a 2x2 matrix , neither the interface of the graphic card settings ( Eyefinity ) 
What do I need to change ? I have an LG OLED TV ( 55B7A ) 
Prior to buying an Apple TV 4k , we were using the built - in Netflix and Amazon Prime apps to watch shows with no complaints 
Once we connected the Apple TV , however , we started getting what I ve since learned is called the " soap opera " effect 
It looks like we re watching a B - movie , or like we re watching a cheap video recording of people on a set 
I did some research and found articles explaining how to disable this effect in the LG TV settings 
I turned off " TruMotion " , noise reduction , and all other " features " that could contribute to this 
However , we re still seeing the effect 
And we did n't have it prior to hooking up the Apple TV 
This tells me that there must be a setting or settings in Apple TV that are contributing 
What can I do to turn it off ? At this point , my wife and I actually prefer to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime on my MacBook Pro or iPad Pro because we HATE the soap opera effect so much 
I m really hoping there s some way to turn it off ! Because this model shipped in 2014 you are looking at a model 5 or more years old and the LCD and backlight has aged and shifted in color so any calibration you find on the web would be for a new 2014 TV and not one with this many years on it 
I d go for self calibration instead for this reason 
Here s CNET and Rtings on that 
So I d go over all the settings , and connections 
For the home button to work ( Sky remote ) then the HDMI CeC function must work 
You can find failed HDMI cables and owners that moved the HDMI cables around so you re never sure if it s simple or will need a new board in the TV or another cable box 
Error after OS Update

Which one of the Chromebooks would be best for a student ? Basically you shop on CPU , RAM , display and keyboard quality 
As I found multiple models in each series I ca n't begin to compare 
We ll use the Chromebooks till they stop working 
I think one of them has n't been updated for years yet it s working 
As to your question , it s going to upset some that you replace the Chromebook when the updates stop 
Or look around to see if you can install Linux then run Chrome there 
Google has been prepping a new operating system outside the duo of Chrome OS and Android ( both running on the Linux kernel ) , named Fuchsia , but it s not clear if the tech giant had any intention of replacing them anytime soon 
Google announced Fuchsia in August 2016 , which is a digression from its tradition of running OSes on Linus and perhaps to serve as an operating system for embedded hardware , especially in the case of embedded devices like car dashboards or GPS units , as the Linux kernel can impact performance and may cause some problems 
Albeit , the rumor that Google has been preparing a new unified operating system to replace Chrome OS ( for Chromebooks ) and Android ( for smartphones ) , is pretty back dated already 
Fuchsia is based on a kernel called Zircon ( formerly known as “ Magenta ” ) , which was originally to serve as an OS for embedded systems due to its “ real - time ” processes 
Though it could theoretically run on any kind of device , such as IoT devices , ATMs , Wearables , even smartphones , tablets and desktops , including all devices powered by ARM and Intel processors 
The new OS which is still in its early developmental stage has garnered support for Apple ’s Swift programming language , adding to several other languages already supported 
So now that it s techtober and the current date is Oct 15 which is also MadeByGoogle day , it is clear that ChromeOS is n't going away 
I would n't say Google has a successful launch of their first Pixelbook device , but they absolutely did with their OS in other separately branded devices 
Now they have decided to create a less ambitious device with the Pixelbook Go 
A regular , moderately priced , hardshell laptop 
I m currently typing this on a MacBook Air with my Pixelbook right beside me , and I can personally say that the Pixelbook Go is much more Mac - esque than it is Pixelbook - esque 
I know I will be getting my hands on it as soon as possible , and will also be using that pretty new Pixel 4 s camera to record some interesting footage 
But back to the question , I think that ChromeOS is here to stay , but the success of this device might decide for how long 
I have a Laptop that does not allow Boot from a " Caddied " Disk 
I keep all my data , media , and other personal stuff in the internal drive , and the OSes are in the caddied drive - Windows ( 2 ) , Linux ( 3 ) 
To permit booting from the Caddied drive , I have a small Linux Distro in the Internal drive that gives me the option to choose the OS I want to boot from , by editing the GRUB 
My question is , can I have just the bare GRUB ( instead of the full Linux Distro ) that can do the same ? If so , how do I go about it ? currently I have windows 10 installed on a cheap 32 GB ASUS laptop 
I no longer have enough room on my laptop to update the system or even use fresh start- I ve uninstalled every app and deleted every unnecessary file , but I still need more room because windows is so huge 
I ve used Linux Mint on another laptop in the past but someone else installed it for me through a cd 
but my laptop does not have a cd drive 
I m sick of windows and the immense amount of room it takes up on my laptop and the " windows defender " software that does nothing more than spy on my activity 
Is it possible to install Linux directly to my laptop like I would an app ? I.e. download the files , hit install , and then run it 
Please help ! With an external drive .. IF you have a bona fide Linux disk it can be done ... because when you boot from the Linux disk it has the option to format the drive and load Linux as the sole OS which is what you would have to do owing to lack of HDD space on your system 
If you are serious about doing this , go online and shop for a Linux OS disk , probably Amazon or some such 
You could download and build your own from the Linux site ... but if you are n't tech savvy it can create some headaches 
Personally on ANY system I want a lot more than 32 GB to do much of anything using any OS 
The thing sounds like a sea anchor to me 
Good luck ... I m not sure I understand your answer and may be reading it wrong ? Windows has issues with Linux and does n't  play nice  Easiest thing to do would be put a live distro on USB drive and set bios to boot from USB first 
I m a motorcycle mechanic but even I know that works 
Even Windows allows you to state where your download can be sent , you do n't have to use default download folder inside Windows just send to USB stick There is nothing called command prompt in Linux 
It s called shell 
And when issuing the command you re already in the shell , so there is no need to open it again 
Maybe you mean something else than you ask 
Where " are you " when you want to open the shell 
On the desktop maybe ? Then can it be your question is : " How do I open the shell from the desktop in Linux Mint Cinnamon " or something like that ? ctrl + alt + t only works some of the time 
You may need to install a different terminal to make it reliable ( I had to install Guake ) The good thing is though , Linux distro s have real people who will actually help you , often giving you everything in a way you just need to copy and paste 
Due to this and not getting constant run around when I do have a problem , I stopped using Win10 in October 2017 
The problem with Linux forums is .. good luck getting in number one and you could be weeks awaiting an answer 
I ve used Linux in one form or another for quite a few years and have generally been able to resolve issues on my own without the aid of a forum 
Mint is the first distro that I have had issues with updates , I do n't recall this type of problem with Ubuntu / Kubuntu 
Oh well , push come to shove .. format and reload 
The new distro upgrade is due out sometime in June you might want to wait and give that a try 
I m going to run the new variant , which supposedly is Mint 20 , on a system as a test before I go all out 
I do n't blame you for going back to Kubuntu , at least for now 
The only issues I have had with Linux have been Since the inception of 19 , there have been a few issues 
My Linux systems are dedicated , I dual booted for years but decided to dedicate a couple of systems to Linux and a couple to Windows and for the most part Linux has worked out well , aside from a couple of burps 
Windows , over the years , has given me way more headaches than has Linux 
Good luck ... Hey , Thank you for your reply 
I have always had struggles with the Boot mode and secure boot settings as it does not allow me to change them , however , the boot mode is set to UEFI and the secure boot mode is disabled 
I took it to a tech 
awhile hack to have ubuntu installed and they mentioned something about the kernel is a problem so they had to install ubuntu 16.04 , however , since then this laptop no longer has any OS running 
The link you provided is for the E 15 , however , mine is an ES 15 
Since you ca n't disable the UEFI and move to a classic BIOS then all bets are off this will ever run on this laptop 
I provided the link because it was the clearest response I ve seen about disabling UEFI on the Acers 
If you ca n't do this then as it stands this laptop is currently incompatible with this OS 
Wo n't be the first time , wo n't be the last 
after rereading your post , it brought back awful memories of problems I had with the kernel and most other linux distros on a couple of my computers 
They would do exactly what you are describing 
It had something to do with the kernal and the video adapter 
there was some change in the kernal that affected the video 
sometimes I could get linux installed in compatibility mode and change the video driver to a third party one 
the only real fix was installing an even older version of linux or going back to win7 
Hello there I have an IBM type machine and a CD with linux mint O / S on it 
I put the CD in the machine and boot from CD but I am brough up a running O / S running off of the CD 
I do nt so any options of installing it onto my HDD First of all , if you use an Android phone or perhaps have a Facebook account , you can stop worrying now , as you can rest assured that Google has taken away more of your privacy than Windows 10 ever will 
Also do keep in mind that a lot of people , including government agencies and large corporations all around the world , do get by with Windows 10 so far 
Please note ! this app is NOT meant to watch or stream any movies and tv shows 
" I can hardly call that a movie player like Netflix 
I m afraid the OP means the APK with a space in the name that shows all the latest high - quality TV shows and movies ( without mentioning any country , so probably from all countries ) 
Did you find that in the store ? but I ca n't see your full screen where on the desktop top left would be the usual Computer , Home and Install Linux Mint 
I m left with no way to test your distro 
That is , if you can tell the forum where you got this .ISO or such then we can boot it and see what it looks like 
Again , it ca n't be a CD since Linux Mint does n't fit on such unless someone made a stripped down version which can explain the install missing 
So it seems this specific computer is not compatible with that version of Linux 
Make it compatible first 
Or try another distro , like Ubuntu or Zorin 
Or try another version of Mint ; there are 3 32-bit and 3 64-bit versions and probably you only tried one of the two cinnamon versions 
When I used FaceBook Messenger in conjunction with Dropbox , it would allow me to access files on Dropbox for sharing , all in the Messenger app itself 
Now I ca n't get Dropbox as an  extension  at all ! I tried making my new device one of the 3 apps 
But now I do nt know what else to do ! Please help ! Hello community 
I am very passionate about watching football channels 
Recently , the ThopTV application is being used by a lot of people to watch movies and TV channels for free so I would love to install it too 
Now I want to ask you how to install ThopTv for android ? I bought an unlocked Galaxy S20 and put it on the Good2Go Mobile n / w ( uses AT&T ’s n / w ) 
Apparently I ’m unable to use wifi calling on G2 G ’s n / w because of AT&T restrictions 
Question : what if I bought an AT&T locked phone and then unlocked it – would I be able to use the wifi calling feature on the G2 G n / w ? The IMEI would ( should ? ? ) be registered w / AT&T … wondering if this would work or if AT&T would again block the feature since it would not be directly on their network 
The issue is that the Wifi calling is considered a premium service and not supported on Good2Go Mobile 
They do not own their own network or towers and merely lease network access 
The solution is to start a monthly plan on At&t and not a prepaid / MVNO 
You could port your current phone 
Thanks your advice R Proffit 
Ironically , I use Google Voice w / my home phone ; I have an Obihai VOIP system that I set up many years ago and it s worked very well 
I ve also considered installing a picocell in my house but from what I ve read , they re all carrier - specific , which would lock me into one of the large carriers , such as AT&T. I m with Good2Go Mobile for two reasons : 1 ) CHEAP ! $ 20/ mo for 3 G of data and unlimited talk/ text 
( I m retired so I need to watch how I spend my shekels ) 2 ) they use ATT s n / w which covers my physical home location - I m WAY out in the country and TMobile , Sprint or VZW do n't have " adequate " service Hi , I ’m new to this site 
Firstly I do n’t know if I ’m on the right page here , but could anyone please kindly help me 
I ’ve been using an app on my phone I ’ve had it a week now it worked fine and all of a sudden I keep getting a message saying that VPN is detected , I do n’t have this and do n’t even know how to use this , however if I use my phone with the app on a different network like in Asda store it works without no problems and no VPN Detection 
Could anyone please help or alternatively direct me to any kind of forums or any other forms of help 
Much appreciated .. Hi , thanks for getting back to me 
Is it possible then that my internet provider has put a VPN on my network because I was under the impression that this was something that you have to do yourself 
The certain app I use will not open on my home network but if I try and use it for example in a WiFi hotspot like a shopping centre with free WiFi it works with no problem 
Is there away that I would be able to tell if my network has had this VPN put on with out me knowing 
Thanks again I have a photo collection of different genres , I want to edit it to make my collection perfect but I m not good at photoshop 
Therefore , I downloaded PicsArt - a photo and video editing application , but there are many features I am not as clear as how I can create a cartoon character on PicsArt ? Please help me answer this question 
While this can edit animated pictures there is no support for that on Android 
As to other pictures you can have a jpeg , png or many others as wallpaper so their is nothing new to cover here about setting an image as wallpaper on Android

Why must the bank charge with port C ? Its charging faster and while using I do n't have to worry about plugging in with right side up 
I have busted few USB Micro cords because of this 
Secondly , USB Micro cords becomes unusable with slight damage to the connecting part 
" But then again I buy from Amazon 
com and their Basics line 
" Even on Amazon , its not cheap 
Originals work the best 
I have bought few USB C cords from eBay , they are very slow charging 
What s Basics line ? Can you please let me know , how is Charmast brand ? Hello everyone , as you all know , TikTok is currently the best and most used social app available , in TikTok , I can create short videos with background music , effects , but yes a problem when I use TikTok 
How do i make my tiktok videos longer than 15 seconds ? Does anyone know , please help ! In my free time , I often play games for fun , I have to admit that it is very addictive 
Some games on Google Play have to pay to download to play , somehow I know I can download and install the modified apk games for free 
How to install modded apk game ? I would be grateful if someone helped me answer it ! At 3:28 AM today I got a message from 58038 that read :  Service Msg : Your phone requires a software update 
You will receive a notification on your phone 
Please click  Install  to update 
It s safe and secure 
 I did not receive a notification about an update , and when I manually check , the updater tells me my phone is up to date already 
Does anyone know how I can get my supposed software update ? I have a ZTE Z557BL on SafeLink Wireless ( TracFone ) and Android 7.1.2001 
I get the same message texted to my phone all the time.e and I have the same phone as you , the ZTE Z557BL or whatever it s called 
I never got the update sent to my phone either 
The settings say my phone is already up to date 
I called SafeLink and the lady I talked to on the phone did n't even know what message I was talking about 
So I m thinking it has to be an error or something on ZTE s side ? ZTE always was a sucky phone in the first place 
I prefer to use Samsung over anything else 
I ve been getting the same message on my Galaxy j7 crown 
The first time I got the message it did give me a update yo install 
I installed it and it changed my whole phone 
Even after that i ve still been receiving the same text 
Just no software update 
What can I do to uninstall the update or whatever it is to get my phone back to normal ? I , too , have a ZTE phone from Safelink and have been getting these texts since at least January - but in the last month or so they ve been coming in a couple times a week 
That s what made me suspicious enough to Google it , which led me here 
I m mortified and ashamed to admit I ve just been texting " Install " each time ... any suggestions to make sure I have n't done anything horrible ? Sometimes avoiding OS updates can prevent certain applications from working properly on the device when the developer no longer offers backward support for older Android versions 
Got ta weigh both options 
Personally I did n't hesitate to update my Samsung Galaxy S9 + when OS 10 was available and have not regretted the decision in any way 
Just sayin ...... 1 
Updating my Win8 to Win8.1 via Windows Store

Thanks in advance

There is a number of Android emulators available for PC to run not only mobile apps and games but also iOS 
Some of the popular emulators for windows are MobiOneStudios , iPadian , and App.io 
While emulators for MAC are iPadian , App.io , and Appetize.io 
By playing a game using an emulator as a gamer you will feel of its original gaming console 
Emulators come up with lots of features , specification as well as some of the more information related to the Android Emulator for PC 
Well , they forgot to tell us the users of Google Nest that their Google Assistant is so dumb that it can not handle the background sound from the TV 
The more the TV Advertisement pop up on TV the mor annoying it becomes 
‘ Hey Google ’ , can you please teach your dumb assistant to deal with your own promotional advertising so it is not interfere with our peaceful time at home 
Just teach your Google Assistant to shut up when the user does not talk to it

Google bans Huawei : they ca n't use their services 
Let s say that the 90 days are over ... and Huawei comes out with their new version of Android 
Could n't you just manually install Google services and the Play Store , like in Fire OS ? Or not ? I need to know what are the features that make android 9 better than the android 8 ? 
If you updated your device from android 8 to android 9 what is your experience with that ? 
Eventually all applications as they get updated would stop working if your phone has an out of date version of Android 
May take more than a year , but it can happen 
Many times , patches / updates fix known issues from occurring on your phone

Hi ! I did some updates on my Samsung Galaxy Orbit J3 and it seems my 3g/4 g is missing 
Now it s eating up all my LTE 
What can I do ? ( Total Wireless ) You will have to speak with Total Wireless for troubleshooting 
Do you know anyone in your local area who is also using Total Wireless ? If so , find out if they are having any connection issues as well 
Are you saying you are not getting any 4 G ( LTE / VOLTE ) connection ? Who provides the network ( At&t , Verizon , etc 
) ? I am wondering if there are any specific power bank ( preferred ) / station 
I can buy that can charge my 18650 batteries via usb / dc 
I use headlamps quite a bit for work and I m tired of continually having to take all 6 of them home every 1 - 2 days for charging 
I m aware that some of these banks are built with 18650s to charge things like tablets / phones / AA , AAA batteries and not the more powerful former 
I use the Samsung Android mobile and normally use it for Facebook logins 
Recently it seems that I can not log into my account and do try to change the password and recover it 
But even I try to log in from another device it can not be done 
Now I only receive the notifications 
How to figure this out ? have also this problem i even lock my facebook account by resting password via mobile which is not a good idea if anyone face this type of error please reset password via PC and put cell number in recovery 
I m in the process of buying a new phone and have so far narrowed my selection to last years Huawei Mate 20 pro and this years Huawei P30 ( not the pro version ) 
As they are both excellent phones , i am having trouble deciding which one to get 
Bear in mind that both are the same price currently where i plan on buying it 
I would appreciate any advice or discussion 
Peace 
I currently have an S5 , with SOME of my music , photos and even some apps on an SD card ( a necessity with only 16 G on the old phone ) , Anyone help with the best way to transfer all this to the new G9 + with Samsung Smart Switch without screwing it up or , even worse , losing some of it in the process ? I understand it will transfer from the old phone SD card , but will it put all the info on the new phone itself , or should a new SD be inserted into the new phone and it will transfer there ? This is what I wound up doing .... Took SD card out of old phone and inserted into new phone ( with the power off ) 
Turned on new phone .... let it do its thing ... used the Smart Switch to transfer from old phone to new .... it worked perfectly ( with the music , pics , etc ... staying on the card , where they were ) 
The only problem I found was a few of the contact info was a bit screwed up , but easy to fix 
I m needing to replace my spouses Samsung Galaxy mega 
I need a little advise on which G7 to purchase 
The G7 verses the G7 power there would n't be games played on it nor would it be used for like utube like myself this is going to be more business oriented and phone calling / emails to text I needed some good advice for the purchase I found out the play is a gaming device which I have the g6 play and I was told for my useage the G7 would be a up grade and more to my liking so a little help with the better half device would be very greatly appreciated from someone who s more phone oriented than me 
I was leaning towards the power g7 because of that battery life for one thing and the spouse is n't that easy at times with a take easy on like a phone ha ha she s kinda do n't worry about that stuff and I like the gorilla Glass just because that s something would help 
The camera she would n't miss and utube and gaming she does n't do I just need a little help they did n't have all stuff available today like when I was kid so it s a little challenging ha ha I really appreciate your advice Since this issue has been discussed for over a decade and the priors do n't work for you is the answer " No 
" ? The most common reason for folk to tell me it s slow is they have a HDD in the PC 
We change it to SSD and what a difference 
Then again , many move to Linux 
One - year pre - paid call / text / data plan expired 
Bought another identical plan 
Inserted new SIM card they supplied , and activated it 
Messaging app ( texting ) displays error message saying payment options must be updated 
That s a bit strange because it s a fully pre - paid plan 
Anyway , updated my payment option at their website 
Error message persists 
Neither texting nor calling will work ; they are blocked 
Contacted FreedomPop support ( by email ) who assured me they would fix it 
After a couple of days I enquired again 
They said they would " escalate the issue " 
Six or seven days after initial contact a different support person emailed me and to say it s a pre - paid plan and I should n't be charged anything or update anything 
Wow , it only took them a week to agree with what I told them at the beginning 
And , they ll let me know the moment they resolve the issue 
That was day before yesterday .... I know maybe you ca n't help me , but I m depressed about what happened to me , create many posts in every forum , I need help , please

The fingerprint ID is not reliable in my Huawei Y9 Prime 
I figured recently It can be unlocked by anyone 
I do n't understand why is this happening 
Its Android 9 and just bought last week 
It s a maker s defect issue so back to them 
You can try on XDA Forums but here I do n't use fingerprint ID at all 
I consider it an experimental feature 
You and others continue to reinforce my view

Does anybody know how to remove factory pre - loaded McAfee off of a computer 
It hangs up in the middle of removal 
The software does not operate with propers protocols for software removal in Windows 
If I do n't want your software on my computer , I should not be made to keep it 
HELP ? ? ! ! I recently became interested in internet protection and security 
I have few questions though 
Can hacker randomly attack someone on Facebook , perhaps only because the victim has a weaker password ( eg a short word and 1 symbol ) , even if he does n't even know the victim ? Could they perhabs try to log into some random account and click on forgot my password and mobile number and somehow " recover " the account only with the help of a password ? Is it necessary to send an email ( phishing ) before or can they just hack the facebook itself ? Does a hacker have to know his victim or can he just break into random accounts ? I purchased an HP computer from the Microsoft Store this last summer 
It cost more since it was pure OS and no bloatware 
I ’ve not downloaded anything on it 
I keep being told that Windows Defender is just as good as any other security software 
But my computer keeps acting up like it ’s infected 
I ’ve had it checked twice and they ( Geek Squad ) say it ’s fine , but within a week it ’s back to freezing , not loading links , etc 
Well , I guess my question is : Is Windows Defender good enough ? I do n’t want to load another security program to bog down my computer 
Also , being on a pension , it ’s costly to have to buy one 
I never pay for virus software 
It is a waste of money 
I ve been using Microsoft Security Essentials ( Defender is a Win 10 reincarnation .. I think ) for years 
I have time and time again rescued other people s infected machines and all had some expensive virus software 
Amazingly , it is a variety of free tools including Microsoft s Malicious Software scanner that usually finds the culprit 
Recently someone who was using the paid version of Avast was infected 
Avast did not intercept nor did it locate the virus on a scan 
The free version of MalwareBytes knocked it off 
Corporate systems have to take a different tact and be on top of their game with a variety of strategies and tactics including relentless user education 
But individuals are wasting their money with paid anti - virus software 
After using my new Windows 10 desktop for a few days I have to say I m a little frustrated with Edge 
On my prior Win7 computer I frequently saved web page shortcuts to the desktop and had about 100 of these 
They were transferred over to my new computer but now I find that many of them no longer work 
In addition , you apparently can not create these types of shortcuts with Edge ! Major faux pas 
Why would they eliminate this capability ? When clicked it opens the site in your default browser 
If your favorite browser is n't Edge , but Chrome or Firefox or Opera or whatever , make that your default browser 
In fact , if Edge doens't do what you want and one of those browser do ( Chrome and Firefox are free ) , in the future use that and forget about Edge 
Spammers have had random naming generators for years - I would immediately assume this is just the usual criminal activity on email 
I get lots of identical email that looks just like my address , but even my little ISP email knows the difference without me even answering them 
They go to the junk mail box , or do n't even reach me and go to the grey mail servers my ISP hires to block this crap - I ca n't believe so many people are falling for this - GMAIL should know better than this as well ! ! ! After finding decent instructions explaining how to do this I exported both my emails and my contacts 
It seemed like both processes were successfully completed but when I open Outlook there seem to be some problems 
When I moved my email files there were messages in the Inbox ( lots ! ) , Sent , and Saved folders 
When I click on the Saved folder the messages appear correct , but when I click on the Inbox and Sent folders there are no old messages displayed 
Why are these messages missing if the transfer process was successful ? My Windows Live contacts list displayed names and associated emails 
When I open the Outlook address book it displays the emails but all of the names are missing 
What happened to the names ? I have acquired a 27 inch monitor for my 18 month old Lenovo 15 inch laptop and intend to retire my 6 year old Dell AIO 
I currently use Office 2010 including Outlook on my AIO 
My plan is to subscribe to Microsoft 365 ( new name for Office 365 ) on the laptop 
I have always received my email to Outlook through my ISP and that has never been satisfactory 
With Microsoft 365 , I have the option of hosting my email there as opposed to my current setup 
This will also enable me to access email from my iphone ( I can get ISP email today but it is not easy or user friendly ) 
I am a longtime user of Outlook and much prefer it to Gmail which I use sparingly 
What decisions and factors do I consider with this approach with Outlook 
I understand that I will have a new email address which will have its own set of challenges 
Will I be able to convert or transfer existing email and archives to my new email host ? Can I direct email with the older email address to my new system ? I believe it will cost $ 4 a month , and if it eliminates the problems I have today , it will be worth it 
The first thing I am doing is subscribing for Microsoft 365 on my laptop which includes the suite of software products including Outlook 
My current Office 2010 software is on my AIO which I am retiring 
I currently get my email through my ISP and it connects to Outlook 2010 
2nd question : The interface between ISP email and Outlook is not the best 
I usually have delays in getting access to Outlook email after i wake the computer up 
Usually about a minute , sometimes more 
Other software products start running much faster , i.e. browsers 
Often get error messages of various types between ISP and Outlook 
Over time ( years ) I have had several PST database corruptions and I suspected the ISP may have had a hand in some of those 
My current setup does work and I am not aware of losing messages , just not a very good interface 
The idea of bypassing the ISP sounds appealing but perhaps a better initial approach is to go with 365 and see how that interface works between the ISP and 365 
Some of the delays and issues I experience could be caused by Outlook 2010 desktop version 
I expect Outlook 365 is a much better product and interface 
Does CNET ever test their site for page load speed ? My Surface 3 takes minutes to load 
The page is always jerking around as another ad or image loads 
It is extremely frustrating 
I minimized with adblocker , but I have to turn off here 
Is there an option to pay for faster load times ? Try to use Firefox browser 
In my experience it is one of the fastest browser available to surf 
When I click on a link I know is safe in an email , Chrome tells me that the site can not be reached 
But all my other browsers go straight to it 
I am talking about links like those in Smithsonian Magazine Newsletter , digital newspaper editions , and city notifications 
I use Windows 10 and Norton Anti - Virus 
Thanks for whatever you may be able to tell me 
And now I just came off a flight booking from hell - it is by an airline where I can pay with loyalty points - but I tried three browsers before I called their help line and let an agent do it for me 
While that was underway I experimented a bit with Chrome , the one browser I had n't tried yet ( it is only installed on my " other " machine 
) And - lo and behold ! - there is a reCAPTCHA suddenly , out of thin air , which my other browsers did n't show me 
The other day I was doing a good deal of online shopping and the proceeding to the checkout failed 
It turned out in the end that I had to switch to my - unloved , only there for emergencies like this - Google Chrome browser 
Then I saw that there was a reCAPTCHA displayed that the other browser ( my trusty old Firefox ) did n't show me 
The trouble here was that I had to rebuild my whole shopping cart on Chrome before I could place the order - as far as I can see , the shopping cart is implemented in cookies and they are not shared between browsers 
On my Android phone Chrome searches come back with findings different than Firefox 
Some times Chrome has better findings than Firefox 
Most times not 
I have a ASUS Switch that displays Edge better than Firefox or Chrome 
Search results are better in Firefox than either Edge or Chrome 
Chrome on any platform most always links the search to other search platforms to other platforms never to an actual answer 
Searches like sweetwater would probably get the search engines that are searching other search engines , But Sweetwater OK would get you map and all manner of statistics 
People who design web sites try their best to work around this 
It get extremely complicated to support all browsers , sometimes needing complex if / then javascript statements to test for which of the many brands and versions of browsers you are using 
No current browser supports all current web standards 
Some do better than others 
But you are always going to run into problems on some sites 
Best you can do is always to keep your browser updated to the very latest version , and keep Safari ( MacOS ) or Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge ( Windows ) , as well as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on all your machines 
Also if a site does n't work try to work out why 
Do you have third party or all cookies blocked ? Do you have pop - up windows blocked ? Do you have an ad - blocker ? Some sites wo n't work with some of these options and you may have to selectively disable them for particular sites 
From the beginnings of the web until my retirement , I was the webmaster at a major government agency justly renowned for its technological prowess , and bad web design really ticks me off ! Any pages put onto the web on any of my servers had to be tested offline first with all the different browsers , from character - based Lynx through Mosaic , Netscape , Arena , Internet Explorer , browsers for the blind , and whatever else came down the pike back in those early days 
Today , you have to test AT LEAST on Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , Safari , and Opera , which will cover more than 99 % of your audience 
I m taking the new Chromium based Edge browser for a test drive 
I seems as fast as the Google Chrome and faster than FF , at least here 
All of my extensions and settings were transferred for Chrome except the home page stayed Microsoft 
I may leave it or go to DDG 
I also like that I can go to the MS store as well as the Google store for extensions 
My only concern is that now that MS has it s fingers in Chromium , will the hackers start hacking like they did with IE and ruin it for us 
We ll see 
Do I understand correctly your webmaster does n't validate his work and publishes html with errors ? That s not what a good webmaster should do 
Educate him 
Or switch to the new Chromium based version of Edge 
If Chrome does n't give this warning , it s likely that version of Edge does n't do it either 
I would n't call it a fix , but it should work for you , if you accept your site has errors 
Have you used Brave Browser ? i had usered for some months 
It is amazing experience with Internet , I feel Brave faster than Google Chrome , Firefox so much , and auto block advertising any web we visit include video on Youtube 
I use my yahoo mail daily and have for years 
I ve noticed that I can only see emails for the past month in my inbox 
My spam and trash have years of emails as do my folders 
I ca n't access the inbox ones from earlier than Dec 27 , 2019 
I tried on my computer and phone 
Any suggestions ? Not a vital problem but annoying nevertheless 
I have the rain alarm extension installed in my Chrome browser 
Works fine , but about a month ago after closing Chrome I get the following message in the right lower corner of my screen : " Rain alarm has crashed 
Click this balloon to restart the app " 
I have tried everything : - remove the app with a thorough cleaning with ccleaner , system ninja and Chrome itself 
- Remove and reinstall Chrome 
Firefox is a browser that focuses on opening web sites rapidly while keeping those nasty pop - ups and spyware at bay 
Firefox was in its final stages last summer and fortunately for the up and coming browser two federal agencies recommended Internet surfers choose a different browser than Internet Explorer due to security issues IE was facing 
This timing was perfect for Firefox and when it absolutely was placed on the web for get there were so many people trying to get at once the server practically could not handle all of the desires 
However , Firefox came through and lots of web surfers switched online Explorer 
In fact , Internet Explorer placed the market share for internet browsers at 95 
5 % , yet has slipped to 80 
9 % in just the month or two Firefox has had its check version on the market 
This might look like just a few percentage points , require percentage points represent an incredible number of individuals who have switched from FOR INSTANCE to Firefox 
In fact , roughly 23 million preview replicates of Firefox have been downloaded 
We all won as we can use what we want 
Today I have Chrome , Chrome as on a Chromebook , Firefox , Opera and can fire up others if someone tells us a web site is troublesome of say the Brave browser 
As my Linux teacher and guru , you remember that I used Linux a few years 
I stopped when I built my new comps but , the only reasons I stopped is because my bank and other sites like Comcast and gaming even with Wine would n't run under it 
I hoped running Chrome , with it s own Flash player would correct that but it did n't , unless things have changed the last few years .... Has always worked for me , although I prefer Firefox for most uses 
I had two places , one a bank , the other a bill pay site , that failed for me 
Chromium however had no problem with the sites 
Since I was using the 32 bit version of Mint Linux , it did n't supply updated Chrome Browser , so dropped it and now use Chromium instead , which works with 32 bit versions of Linux 
However , if one wants to use current Chrome Browser , it does have a current version for the 64 bit versions of Linux 
My main complaint against Linux right now is the way they all ran after " systemd " overlay system , which created a couple problems for me , and it s a bear to diagnose at times too 
Added almost 1500 more files , and for the original stated reason to " speed up boot times " which was of the least concern to me since I usually suspend , sometimes for months of uptime too 
The separate manual for that added overlay " systemd " is about 250 " man pages " long ! The one halfway decent systemd free version is currently MX Linux , and maybe Devuan ( broke away from Debian over this ) , but I ve not tested Devuan Linux yet 
Reason I ve not gone over to MX Linux , which can be installed with or without systemd in it , is what I consider the scattered manner in where numerous settings are located 
Normal users do n't want to take diagnostics and corrective measures at all , that s why they run Windows 
If there is any issue ( usually there is n't ) , there s a lot of help from Google , forums and knowledgeable friends 
And most of what they learned in the past ( about Windows XP or 7 ) is still valid or changed in a way that s not too difficult to understand 
since that is the one used with mobile phones 
However , nationwide is a large insurance site , can you imagine if same DNS error I received , suddenly that happened to people trying to visit Amazon , Facebook , Twitter , EBay or major media sites ? I had " no proxy " set , and no warning of FF changing that , restricted to their browser when used 
I was able to use Chromium browser , and it worked , so that s how I knew it had to be something in Firefox doing it 
When I called Comcast , they walked me through steps that showed I can view and send email fine from the online Comcast account they support 
However , I have never used the comcast online email because I have email archives on my Windows Live ( I think formerly Outlook ) mailbox categorized in sub - folders dating back to 2008 
I ve never been able to view my history sub - folders using the online comcast capability , and the Windows Live provided me everything I needed via a simple desktop icon click 
Whether using the Comcast server or my work iPhone capability to view my home comcast emails , I have experienced that Windows Live appears to be my primary email database 
That is , when the Comcast agent showed me how to use the Comcast site yesterday it showed zero messages in my inbox , and on my work phone I only see emails received after my last use of Windows Live , and the messages all disappear once I ve again visited Windows Live ( where all emails appear as new , even if I ve previously viewed them on the Comcast site or my work phone ) 
Windows Live emails never disappear unless manually deleted 
I think my existing Windows Live at one point ( years ago ) was the one and only way to view comcast emails , and just survives on as if it is my email  home location 
 Is there a way to have Windows Live no longer the primary location for emails ? That is , if I go with a company like Thunderbird , will I experience the same and have all email there disappears if I ever visit the Windows Live for email archives only ? I do n't use Windows Live Mail ( it s old and unsupported ) , but I looked at the server settings for Thunderbird 
It has 2 options for smtp that might be interesting : - Connection security : none , starttls , sls / tls 
- Authentication method : none , unencrypted password , encrypted password , kerberos / gssapi , ntlm , Oauth2 and , of course , it has a username 
You re going far too fast 
I was just asking to experiment with another email program to see if you could get those to send mails 
If they do , you know what settings are necessary and you can try to fix the current settings in Windows Live Mail 
Your WLM copies mails from the inbox on the Comcast server to your PC ( and they are new there ) and then immediately deletes them from that server 
That s why you ca n't see them from your iPhone or browser , because those two look at what is there ( and not yet moved to your PC ) 
Tech Disadvantaged - Did you get your email Send function to work ? The thread ended rather abruptly , so I wondered 
The Send issues were resolved , I made a simple change in email account properties , and Send function works again ! Like you , I have been hesitant to switch to a different email program , because Windows Live has the perfect format and functionality for me 
It s advisable to switch in the near future , though , to enable regular upgrades and security updates 
I would use Windows Live as an archive of old messages 
I have been looking at Outlook , Mailbird , eM Client , and Thunderbird 
Have you checked into any of these ? MS Word and such ca n't make such a document until an A3 printer driver is installed 
I ve repeated this for other page sizes so I wo n't do any research about it 
My answer will be short : Install a printer driver , set the printer to A3 then back to Word to see about selected a page size

Hi there 
Windows 7 , Firefox , I have saved a " Print to file " which made an .XPS file 
When I open it , it opens in XPS Viewer but the pages are blank , if I open it in Word it shows code ... How do I view it or somehow save THAT file in a different , readable / viewable format ? If your team is small , if you only have one team , if you do n’t need the extraneous bells and whistles of Flock , if you need a specific yet uncommon app integration , or if you prefer as minimal an interface as possible , then go with Slack 
But on the whole , Flock is outright better for most users 
You have a list of requirements and it s very common to hear complaints about just about every CRM 
There are cloud based systems where you or your IT do n't have to setup a server and then the old way of setting up the server and services 
Today folk want the cloud based if they have no IT staff 
That grunt work is vastly reduced with cloud based CRMs like Salesforce and then go up enormously with the old server based method 
Even the setup of the email system has bested many IT staffers so asking that is be simple means cloud based to me 
I have a laptop that did have Office 2010 Professional Plus on it and we just upgraded it to Office 2019 Professional Plus 
She had custom templates that she had made on Office 2010 in word that I ca n't find now in 2019 
Can i migrate those over somehow or are they just gone ? I have been using Office 365 without problem until yesterday 
Now for both Word and Excel I get the following message , " We re sorry but Excel ( Word ) has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly 
Excel ( Word ) will need to close as a result 
Would you like us to repair now ? " So I click repair now and the software starts working , but in less than 5 minutes it shuts down completely 
Anyone have any ideas ? Thanks kindly for your help 
And now I m seeing this message whenever I open MS Word : " File not found : /Library / Application Support / MACPDFM / MacPDFM.framework / Versions / A / MacPDFM " 
Do I need to uninstall and then reinstall Word ? Or is there some folder that I can just download?I'm afraid that unininstalling and reinstall Word wo n't help 
Apparently , Adobe installed some add - on for Word and told Word to load it , so you could use it 
Now you must tell Word that there s no need anymore to link to it 
I am trying to look for a free and multi - tools PDF converter software , I have been using one for sometimes , I hope some others can suggest or recommend some new PDF converter software 
I am hoping to look for offline instead of online because I want my data to be more secure and safe 
IF the PDF software supports batch conversion is highly recommend too 
Actually the PDF software from Bitwar is doing perfectly fine and the PDF tools are really good and outstanding according to the price of the software which I bought the One year license of the software because I looked for some other PDF editor software which may cost 2x or 3x or even higher price more expensive than Deli PDF converter software but the Tools and the formats supported are almost the same and the results are both excellent as well 
Therefore , Deli PDF software is actually well priced and good for most users for converting PDF and editing PDF 
For example like Adobe , Acrobat Dc is a dynamic PDF editor software by Adobe but it costs a lot of money for the software just to perform PDF conversions 
In the end , I am not saying Deli PDF is a better product compared to Adobe Acrobat DC but just for many users like me just need to perform PDF conversion to word or excel , is actually more than enough by using Deli PDF converter and as a passionate user , I also would like to open for more PDF converter that is useful or many popular used by other Users ! Still , thanks to the moderator for your feedback and opinion on Bitwar , Looking for more help and suggestions from all other Cnet users too 
What is the old source , and what is the new source 
Both in Office 2010 and in Office 365 ? And how many links are changing ? If everything is on the SSD in your own laptop / PC it s much faster than if everything is in the cloud 
Thart might be part of the explanation 
I do n't have access to Libre Office 
The grid is 15 rows by 5 columns 
Makes no difference if the files are local on my laptop 
I can find lots of people moaning about this on the internet but no one seems to have found a solution 
Once a month I have about 1/2 day of re - linking ( mostly by macro ) 
For that to take 30 times longer is not an option 
At some point I will no longer have access to Excel 2010 
Microsoft technical support say nothing is wrong with the program , it s how I m using it 
How else are you supposed to link spreadsheets ? As to the moaning and such , I doubt Microsoft is going to address this 
This means we get to address it by using our old Office or trying a new one 
What is this about no access to Excel 2010 ? At home and office we duplicated the install media as per our rights and while we run Office 2013 I m glad to report it still installs and runs fine ( I wo n't list the small things that do n't work anymore ) we only use Office 365 where we need it 
Please make a new question in this forum , telling you want to use the webcam in your Windows 10 ( that s right ? ) laptop to record a video and asking what sotware our members recommend 
It might be useful to explain why you do n't plan to use your smartphone for the purpose 
I m afraid that you sittting before a screen on that distance , moving your eyes or head from left to right to read the text and down sometimes to find the page - down key does n't make for a very good broadcast 
If I see myself in a Skype or Zoom meeting , it certainly does n't look like something to publish 
But since the other participants look just as horrible , it has to be done 
- The first list is about the type of output you want 
Choose from JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Bitmap , OpenXPS or PDF 
That s totally up to you 
- The second list is about what you want to scan 
Try all and see what you like most 
- The third list is about how sharp the copy must be 
The more pixels on an inch , the longer the scan takes , the larger the resulting output file is and the more details you will be able to see 
Start with 400 and 700 , compare the results and then decide on the final value you use 
If it s for showing on a webpage , phone , tablet or website , there is no need for a very high value 
If you want to print it , there is no need to go higher than the highest resolution of the printer

Hi : I m looking for a free video editor to get started with that will run on 32bit WIN7 and record webcam audio and video from a Zoom HandiCam 
The idea is to make amateur level split screen music videos for FB and YT including footage from other musos 
I ll need to be able to mix audio volumes , and it would be useful to have basic colour adjustment to get my clips to look the same as those sent me by other musicians 
One of them uses Pinnacle Studio Ultimate , but that requires 64 bit and more PC power than I have 
Thanks , Max 
As to 64 bit Windows long ago I did a test where I installed Windows 7 in 32 then 64 bit using the same activation code 
Worked fine so the only limitation here is you 
There s also a way to run Windows 10 without activation ( not a crack , just how it is with W10 ) and we can upgrade to W10 from W7 at no cost still ( did it 2 weeks ago 
) So there is again no limitation there as to the new OS except the owner or client 
If they wo n't budge you leave them in the rut they are in 
Thanks for that , R Proffitt 
Upgrading to W10 is an option I m looking at 
What puts me off is suggestions I might then have trouble running a bunch of legacy software I use , and difficulty finding 64 bit W10 drivers for these old laptops ( Acer 8920/8730 - Intel Duo T6400 , 3Gb , Win7 Home Premium ) 
Shotcut and VSDC Free appear to run OK on them 
My question is really what 32 bit vid software will get me started on this without too long a learning curve to do what I want initially 
Once I upgrade to a recent PC I ll probably change to one of the current 64 bit standard editors 
That is actually the Core 2 Duo and my son has this Sony with a Core 2 Duo which we changed the HDD to SSD and install W10 
In that laptop there was no need to look for drivers 
Windows 10 did all the hard work and all the hardware works 
This laptop was returned to me , the SSD fitted and the upgrade to W10 and now is used by my neighbor as a YouTube , Web'ing it up and music player 
It plays 1080p Netflix without issue to a big screen HDTV 
When I try to convert files in Sony Media Go , the converted file gets deleted 
I use more than one media converter but one that I use over and over is VLC Player 
Plenty of articles about it s use as a converter so I ll pause here 
After repeated tries , I can not find a way to prohibit users at a meeting I set up to not turn on video 
In test upon test , we have not succeeded and users can always turn on their own video 
Any thoughts ? Thank you 
If they turn it on , they get ejected 
I m not Zoom s support so I take it they failed your feature request and all I can offer is to put it out as " Policy " along with what will happen 
Nice detective work 
Looks like you had to dig deep on the Zoom support to locate that - well done 
do we have any other way other than photoshop or after - effects to remove the watermark ? I found out that VLC help me remove it but still it s not professional enough 
I saw many of the graphics Designer used to do that illegal practice when I hire a freelancer from one the famous freelancing platform for my product title as buy cbd hemp buds to create video and watermark the title on that video they used the template video and edit watermark and delivered it to me when I saw an illegal activity I report to the freelance platform and they take a strick action him 
Canva is a tool of designing the creatives like if you want to create some professional creatives like related to business , festival and promotional tips or any topic you want

you can use it in your mobile or laptop 
canva have many option of background and specially it is having a grate collection of images 
Why is everyone trying to build links on this forum ? I mean yes moderators remove all the links even the informative ones but people doing link building is just not right 
For photo editing , professionals use the software from Adobe , especially Photoshop 
So that certainly ranks very high 
For web design , this is the wrong forum , so I wo n't answer that question here 
Moreover , there is no best ; one reason is that it depends on the requirements for the site 
By far the best photo editing software for Photo editing is Adobe Lightroom 
With the help of adobe lightroom , you can correct the lighting of your photo and make it look attractive ... You can also go with photoshop for making major changes in your posts ... The best software is the one that you find that it helps you achieve what you need and you can use is with out much trouble 
Adobe products are very good , but require some knowledge on how to use them 
Also , can be expensive for some 
Online editors like PixTeller can give similar results in many cases , are easier to use , free , and you can use them from any PC 
Since there are many programs to edit your pics on your PC ( or even tablet ) , either locally or on the web , and then upload it to your Wordpress site , why would you need a " Wordpress Image Editor " plugin ? And what s wrong with the one you recommended in an earlier post ? Why do you need more than one ? The photoshop is an better one compare to illustrator , Photoshop it is an great program for modifying already created images and it have many features compare to illustrator and also famous among all the graphics tool 
I do n't like Illustrator , I think Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom are the best tools to retouch photos and make the size required 
Moreover , Lightroom is great to view all images within a folder and you can organize and view / edit images there too , but tastes differ 
Yes , some parts are very crappy but back when I was buying this PC I had really tight budget 
Anyways my GPU recenlty died and I am looking for a quick replacement but I am worried that I will choose the wrong GPU so my Power Supply wo n't be able to handle it 
These are GPUs that I wanted to buy : Zotac GTX 1060 6 GB Mini , MSI / Asus R9 380 Gaming 4 GB , Asus GTX 970 4 GB , MSI RX 470 4 GB 
So from these tests I fugured that I can probably go with even better GPUs for this current Power Supply I got 
The GTX 1060 I looked up was mini version by ZOTAC , it says on some websites I looked up that it s TDP was around 130W , so that is why I was worried 
This version you tested is probably better option than this one , so if it can go along with my current PSU I would deffinitely consider it 
I plan to upgrade my CPU to i7 4790 and buy SSD also , so I want to make some room for that if possible 
My son s GTX 970 and others are failing now 
This old GPU did well but there s likely a reason it s available 
The ones I know of let the PC boot but give strange issues in games 
From artifacting to crashes which are hard to figure out 
I ve seen folk spend months asking others to read Windows core dump files over this 
At least in our shop we know the signs and swap the GPU early for testing 
Hello dear peoples 
I have an question about my XBOX ONE X 
Bought it month ago , from shop new 
I ’ve noticed one time , that if I leave the Division 2 idle for about a half hour or so the entire Xbox one x turns off 
It ’s definitely not something in the Xbox settings , is the only game that does that while being idle 
Second time it shutted off when loading game on 14 % 
I already have a RX 590 , a Ryzen 2600 by itself ( no heatsink ) is on its way , and I have some 16 GB 3000 MHz memory I ll use until I can find some faster for cheaper ( 1 - 2 days ago there was 16 GB 3600 MHz for almost 20 % cheaper so I ll keep an eye out for a couple weeks if I can find something as cheap ) 
I need the rest of the system 
Just in case it s necessary : I have a mid - tower and Freesync 4 K monitor 
I do n't see anything about a 2600 on the URL you provided and I d like a suggestion for a system that must contain a Ryzen 2600 & RX 590 
I do n't think I even get 20 FPS currently w/o seeing tearing , if I can get to that point it would be nice 
I do n't play FPS , so there s no need to see things really quickly ; I just want it to look good 
If once I setup the 2600 system , if it persist and I ca n't stand it , I ll try 1440p 
Option A : Sell the i7 , motherboard and 8 + 4 gb ram for 170usd ( ₱9000 ) and get a Ryzen 5 2600 , B450 and 16 gb 3200MHz bundle for 280usd ( ₱14000 ) 
Option B : Sell the RX470 for 120usd ( ₱6000 ) and get a GTX 1070 for 200usd ( ₱10000 ) 
The i7 is more than capable for 1080p gaming so let s compare the 470 and 1070 
By the Ryzen instructions , I removed the 2 CPU brackets and put in the CPU 
When I got to the Wraith Spire , I attempted to fasten it into the 4 empty holes that previously held the brackets 
It does n't seem to be fastening to the motherboard as I expected so I m unsure of how this goes 
While I ve installed hundreds if not ten times more CPU cooling setups I ca n't answer because I do n't have your board and cooler 
But I will write that many kits have extra bits and they leave you to figure it out 
If this one is that hard , try another make or try the stock cooler from AMD 
I ve have n't tried to open all of my games to see if they were affected by this problem , but I know that my problem does n't occur for Rainbow 6 and Far Cry 5 
I m not an expert in PC 
Thank you in advance for helping me out 
Specs : i5 - 9600k / RTX 2060 / 16 GB / 700 watts 
I bought my desktop a year and a half ago and it was brand new 
Monitor : AORUS AD27QD , Cpu : i7 - 9900 K stock 4.7 with Noctua NH - D15 , Gpu : Rtx 2080 Ti Aorus Xtreme Waterforce ( stock no oc , temps max 63C on load ) , Ram : 32 gb 2x16 GB DDR4 GSKILL 3000MHZ XMP , Psu : Seasonic Ultra Prime Titanium 850W , mobo : Asus Prime Z390-A , SSD : Crucial 1 TB , HDD : WB BLUE 1 TB , Case : Cooler Master Cosmos C700P 
In short I m an osu player and was looking to upgrade to 144hz monitor with 1ms response time 
I usually have 480 FPS in osu with this graphics card ( gtx 750 ) however i just wanna make sure I do n't waste my money for no improvement 
I do n't know much about monitors but i heard that not all connections support 144hz so I was wondering if it would work 
What do you think would be the best setup for upgrading my old Alienware ? Here’re the current specs : MB : Z97MX - Gaming 5 , i5 4690 K @3.50 ghz , 8 GB RAM , GeForce GTX 960 1 GB 
It s pretty much expected to barely break 30 FPS at times with a single RTX 2080 so to fix that you use a pair of RTX 2080 s 
And that s a problem of power and heat 
The power is fixed with a new large PSU 
But then when you slam in a pair of RTX 2080 s your motherboard may not space them out 
Here s a video on the build for getting to 60 and up FPS at UHD 4K 
Hello I have a hp notebook 15 model hp 15-f272wm and I need help finding out what type of ram chip I need and if I can use this one 
You have a HP 15 and the sticks call out HP 15 
Only the supplier can answer further 
Here I stick with Crucial.com since they have a better memory finder 
Hi guys 
Christmas is coming and I will get a graphics card 
I used to have a gtx 760 that died almost two years ago and I think it´s time to become a gamer once again lol 
The thing is that i´m from argentina and well , our economy isn´t the best so the best I could buy is an RX 570 4 GB 
There is a very well known place here that has the best prices and they have the MSI armor 4 GB and the Sapphire Pulse 4 GB at the same price 
Which one should I get ? I couldn´t find a proper comparison between them and the only difference I have seen is that the Sapphire one has a backplate 
I just updated my GeForce GTX 1070 to the RTX 2070 super 
When I go to DirectX Diagnostic Tool ( dxdiag ) everything shows and has a driver installed dated 12/5/2019 
When I tried launching a game to determine what graphics I should play with , it said it could n't detect a video card or something similar 
I posted the specs below but every part in my computer is less than 3 months old and games are running incredibly slow 
Specs : CPU : Core i7 - 9700 3.0 GhZ quadcore , Ram : 32 GB GDDR 5 RAM , Motherboard : Gigabyte Z390 UD , SSD : 1 TB , OS : Windows 10 Home 64 Bit , Bios Version : American Megatrends Inc. F8 , 5/24/2019 , Chipset : Intel ( R ) 300 Series Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller , Game : Fallout 4 
Hopefully you can correct this glaring issue 
All that said , I do n't advise less than the RTX 2080 for UHD 4 K gameplay and then NEVER on HDMI 
We want to see display port and the 2080 if not a dual 2080 for UDH 4 K happiness 
Since is just a 28 inch monitor you would find me setting the video mode to 1080p 60Hz and let it rip in full RTX glory 
I recently picked up a gigabyte aorus 2080 , but the lighting does n't work right 
No matter what effect i put on it , the LEDs flash to different solid colors at random times during the animation 
I tried uninstalling my drivers and getting a new bios , but none of it has helped 
These lighting systems are still hit and miss 
You ll have to get your motherboard maker to tell you if they support your GPU maker on this 
And the GPU maker will have to tell you the same 
I have an HP Server dl380 G10 , it was working fine for several months , but suddenly it started to shut down by itself at random times , with all the leds flashing for three times which means memory power fault as by the documentation , when starting over the server and running all diagnostics for the memory and HDD they all are passed , stress test is passed for 48 hours , but the server still crashes at random time , from the iLO 5 the reported error is under BIOS / HARDWARE HEALTH which is always green and OK unless when the server is crashed it gives the System Error 
If you want to get super - accurate colors for photo editing then you need to buy a high - end monitor that ’s relatively kind to your wallet 
Here are few best monitor for photoshop editing 
BenQ SW2700PT , ASUS ProArt PA329Q , Eizo ColorEdge CG319X , Dell UltraSharp U2518D , Viewsonic VP3881 
Was sitting on YouTube , laptop turned itself off for no apparent reason 
Charge was almost full , plugged it in in case , no dice 
LED light was on for the charger a bit ago but disappeared after I pressed down for a few on power and the fan whirred like it was ready to start and then did n't 
Taken battery and charger out for now as it is getting quite hot for something that is n't actually on 
Any help would be appreciated 
Hi , I have an Acer ( GN246HL ) monitor that does n't have a DP , but instead uses DUAL - LINK DVI to recieve a 144HZ signal 
I m looking to build a new PC , but struggling to find graphics cards that describe support for dual - link DVI in the sub - £200 region 
I would prefer to buy new ( I can look into used if really necessary ) 
Does anyone know of any decent GPUs that support dual - link DVI ? I can only , at best , find cards that support regular DVI and I do n't understand whether that s different to dual - link 
( I was looking at rx 570s and gtx 1650s and they supported DVI , not sure if this means it will work with my monitor or not ? ) if I buy a card that has DVI ( like an RX 570 or 580 ) , it ll be dual link ? And I can avoid problems if I do n't buy an RTX card ( which I ca n't afford anyway ) ? Thanks for replying 
I ll probably look into the 1660s , although I might try an rx 570 by a maker that includes DVI - it s performance level is about perfect for my eSports usecase and if I can get a cheaper card that supports my monitor I m all for it 
I think I understand how this DVI business works a bit more now ! While you did tell me RX 570 or 580 it s too much work for me to build such a list so I do n't do that 
I defer to makers since if the maker will not answer questions now , they wo n't later 
Why not the EVGA 1660 s as those are great performers and seem to be enough GPU to get most games up to 144Hz 
That is , I would not try this on the 1650 or lower 
I have an asus formula vii mobo and the mentioned processor 
I use the H1115i AiO cooler from corsair 
I mainly play World of Warcraft on my computer so nothing too fancy where I need to overclock my system , just run at normal typically does n't cause any stress at all 
But a while back the fans on my AiO started going crazy and I am not sure why 
Temps are around 40 deg C and the fans at 40 deg C ramp up and down until they are WIDE OPEN ( 2200 rpms ) and it sounds like its trying to take off from under my desk ... Anyone have any ideas ? Would let the BIOS control the fan speed , be sure the BIOS is current and the fan is on the CPU fan ( motherboard ) connection 
After that , post in Asus s own motherboard forum if that did n't clear it up 
I m running w10 32-bit on my pc and using a Samsung 192mp monitor via a DVI cable 
Works fine once I m signed in , but having issues during windows boot : getting some inputs up until windows " tune " plays , but then screen goes black and eventually screen goes into standby 
If I turn the monitor off and back on , the windows log - on screen appears 
How to fix this ? Another monitor on DisplayPort 
HDMI did work better but then I lose some other feature 
ALL THIS was kicked around and it came back to a PC issue and not the monitor which I suspect is the same as your W10 32 issue here 
My thought is this is yet again driver or bios related 
Get your PC and card maker to share how to update that 
Currently have an LG 27UD69P that I have had for over 2 years now 
I use it with my Xbox One X 
Are there any monitors out there that you think are better than my current display and are $ 500 or cheaper ? My only quibble is the volume controls 
But it s really a nice monitor 
Ok , during a iPhone sync , the system seemed to be hung up and was taking a very long time 
I thought there was an issue so I turned off the computer by holding down the power button 
( Yes I know that was stupid and I know better , please put my stupidity aside ... ) so when I restarted I got a missing BOOTMGR error so I tried to to repair with my windows install disc 
Auto repair did not work , I ’ve tried multiple cmd repair commands 
Nothing seems to help , and I ’m not sure but that may have made things worse 
? I decided to boot up with a different HDD in hopes to either repair the ssd or at the very least get some files I need off the drive 
FYI , the windows repair disc does not show an OS to select to repair so I do n’t know if that ’s another problem 
So that ’s the first part of the problems 
The SSD is listed in my bios , it is listed in device manager and also listed in drive manager 
Device manager Shows no issues with the drive , other than it only recognizes 8 mb on a 120 GB drive 
Drive manager says the drive is offline , there is no drive letter assigned and also only recognizes it as 8 mb 
The drive does not show up when clicking on “ my computer ” 
If I initialize the drive and follow the prompts , the system wants to format the drive 
( If I format it will erase everything , right ? ) I do not let it format the drive so it still ca nt be read as the drive is listed as raw 
Also , when restarting the computer , that drive returns to offline 
Is there any way to save this drive 
Or at the very least get my files off of it ? I know there are many software file recovery options available but until I can get the drive to work or be recognized I ca n’t use any of those software options to retrieve any data 
This fail and recovery is in the thousands of dollars as the only shop that did such would have to find another drive of the same make and model to move the flash chips from the old to the new drive and hope the data survives 
HDDs tend to have other failures where the file system is the problem but flash can be no recovery most of the time 
The recovery houses will likely not accept it for recovery 
It s been a one way ticket to the bin 
All skill levels arrive here so if you were to take it apart I hope you have the usual PGA , reball and more gear and experience 
The reflow machine runs about 4 grand so it s rare to find a member with that or access to this workstation 
Again , I do not want to mention that backup of 120 GB is cheap 
Let s hope that as a seasoned Windows 7 user you know to prepare for this day 
Then the drive is usually dead and not a file system failure 
This moves it into the over 1 buck recovery house category 
Unlike HDD where they have 300 buck recovery offers , SSD is a whole different animal 
Such a loss can be where folk learn why so many write about backups 
But once in a while the client / member / person is in crisis mode and will yell " Not helping 
" So I try to avoid that discussion till they are ready 
Well I got the drive working again and back to 120 GB 
Unfortunately , all data has been lost 
I did do the quick format per the directions I found 
The drive needs to be formatted in order to reset the drive back to the full capacity 
In addition , I still had to do a second quick format in order to make the drive scannable with Recuva 
The drive needed to be initialized and formatted as it was set as RAW 
Thanks for all the info you provided 
Looking for a solid memory upgrade for my Z170A SLI Plus mobo , I am currently running 16 GB of Kingston HyperX FURY Black 8GBx2 2133MHz DDR4 
Looking for 32 GB worth , for gaming and running a VM in Hyper - V 
Thanks all 
That said I usually run at most two VMs at the same time 
Before you go with that much RAM did you eject all HDDs for SSD ? Crucial is my goto 
For your selected RAM , the maker should answer 
So , I just got a 2700x because they are on a great sale right now and I needed more for streaming than a 6700k 
So , after I got the 2700x installed I immediately started overclocking and was able to get up to 4.3 on 4.5v I think it was 
I then dialed it back to 4.2 after a crash on 4.4 
Then idk when it exactly happened but , instead of a score of 1721 on 1.35v ( which I looked up and I think I should have a higher score than that but , let s ignore that for now ) 
I got a 1450 I think it was and I tried everything for hours after that to get it back to the old score 
Such as clearing cmos , more voltage , higher ram overclock , the pbo , putting it back on stock settings , everything I could think of 
But , the weirdest thing about what s happening is that the same thing happened on my 6700k 
It dropped from a 890 to like 650 or something 
So i m at a loss here and need help 
Hello all , I have a quick question 
What would be a better choice out of these two 
thinkpad p71 with xeon e3 v6 1505 m with quadro p5000 
or thinkpad p72 with xeone 2176 m with quadro p4200 gpu 
this model is roughly 300 dollars more 
I am afraid that the p71 processor will bottleneck the p5000 gpu 
any input would be great , thanks 
The i5 - 2500 where we could drive THREE GPUs at full tilt 
Now maybe if the app / game used a lot of CPU one could call that a bottleneck but it is not 
The CPU<>GPU < > GPU bottleneck for the longest time was the transfer speed from one to the other 
I am looking to upgrade my GPU to accommodate either a 4 K monitor or at the very least something better than 1080p ( better resolution ) , my current specs are below , budget would be around $ 300.00 MAX , $ 200.00 would be better , this is strictly for gaming really 
Mobo : Z170A SLI Plus , CPU : i7 - 6700 K 4.00GHz , Memory : Kingston HyperX FURY Black 16 GB 2133MHz DDR4 , GPU : Radeon RX 580 8 GB , Power Supply : EVGA 600 B1 , 80 + BRONZE 600W. At that price you should shop in the 2 K Gaming monitors 
Lots of reasons to avoid UHD 4 K since the current GPU is n't enough and you could blow a thousand and still not be happy 
Take my advice : Look at 2 K monitors 
Hi , I want to build AMD 1000 $ gaming pc and I need help choosing parts 
The PC should run gta 5 and battlefield at high resolution 
Hi I just built a new computer and unlike my last build , this one has a 12pin power , a standard 8pin and an extra 4pin 
The motherboard is a Asus rog maximus xi hero , and I m using a 9700k , 1080ti , and the PSU is an EVGA 850 supernova g2 
And my psu only came with 2 CPU power cables , both of them being the split 8pin ( 4 and 4 ) 
Hello , I have a big problem since my dell T7500 does n’t want to boot Win 7 , here ’s how it happened 
Basically , I just clean the interior of my PC softly with a vacuum cleaner and I think I did nt unplug anything But when I tried to power on my pc 
I boots normally and it says MPT boot successfully installed ! It looks like it stucks because it ’s been 30 minutes and it still did n’t start up with windows 7 
Please help , thank you 
The method for decades has been canned air 
Try the usual 
Reset the BIOS ( check your Dell Docs ) and see if it starts up 
Next is remove power and gently push all cards and connections home 
Reset and test again 
I ve had this issue before , it was due to the computer trying to boot from the windows install disc / USB rather than the hardrive 
Remove the disc / usb and all should be well 
Also , let s start with known good builds like https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds 
PCMR has builds that not 60FPS Gamer and go up from there 
Now if you want to game at UHD 4 K I used to write no but today that gamer can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCfmM71NOTo but the GPUs alone are more than your budget today 
I have been tinkering with settings since i got this problem have reset chrome and reinstalled but i do nt think chrome is to blame 
no matter the browser i use edge , IE , Chrome i get the same result 
a page of invisible results 
i ve tried turning off , windows defender and adding chrome to firewall acceptions 
I keep getting the same thing 
it is like google is working fine but i can not see ANY of the search results it provides but i can click on them like i normally would and it will take me to the link i clicked on 
very annoying have not found a forum with a similar problem and have been using bing for the past few days as it works as it should 
any suggestions will be appreciated thank you in advance ! Some times we face these kind of issues but it can be solved following these steps 
Snap the Tools menu 
Select Internet Options 
Go to the Advanced tab , and put a check mark by Use programming rendering rather than GPU rendering 
Close and restart Internet Explorer and afterward sign into Web TimeSheet and the clear page would not come up once more 
Long history short , i updated my AMD RX 560 drivers , i had some resolution problems and my second screen was n't working , i reinstalled Windows 10 64b because i was fed up , but now my GPU is not getting dedected in any way shape or form , trust me , i tried EVERYTHING , the hardware Works on other computers , i cleaned it , its a software problem 
Samsungs and other models require you stick to the maker s issued drivers 
Samsung on top of that may not hand out drivers but some driver update app 
YES I do see this appears to be some built desktop 
And BEST OF ALL REASONS : Microsoft Windows has NEVER installed drivers , BIOS and such in the right order for us 
It s been over 2 decades and a Windows install still requires us to work at it to get a good install 
I had a strong sense of that 
I remember a thread where two RX520 video cards were involved , even pictures posted of them , and one never worked , no matter how it was tried 
I thought it was here on CNET , but maybe was in another forum I frequent 
For most , the best option is to disable Microsoft s automatic installation of device drivers 
That way , they ca n't automatic install such drivers and cause the problem 
And if the drivers have been incorrectly installed by Microsoft , then visit the network device manufacturer s website , or the computer manufacturer s website and install the correct network drivers from those sites 
Once that s done , disable automatic driver updates by using the steps below , then in the link below 
So , there s two Radeon graphics involved 
Can the onboard video run a monitor at this time ? When you installed drivers after reinstall of W10 , you made sure to install the drivers for the onboard video chip also ? Has W10 done any updates since that time ? If so , then W10 may have installed different driver files 
Do you have W10 set to disallow new hardware/ driver updates yet ? I used my computer yesterday and I run it again today 
Suddenly , I saw a sky blue screen on the computer screen and it turned off black again and sky blue again 
I turned off the computer and turned it on again 
But they said they were preparing for automatic repair , but it came up on the bottom and went back to the black screen 
I can see the mouse cursor , but it wo n't go over the screen anymore 
I ve been using this computer for 3 years and it is Windows 10 
Sometimes you have to do a reinstall and others just by letting it run it will work itself out it all depends on what has gone wrong 
The last one I had wel several anyway required to be turned on and allowed to run for a couple of hours then turned off and restarted for an hour then turned off and on several times for extended periods of time but never over 30 minutes and then a Secure Boot Error was displayed and on the next reboot it loaded up and started with all of the data and software present 
Another one that came about from a Windows Patch not sure which one resulted in the nB eventually reloading with a NEW CLEAN INSTALL of Windows and everything else was history and short of doing a very invasive Data Recovery run on the HDD everything was gone never to be seen again 
Not sure what happened there but with all of those mentioned above I was not there when they went Haywire and only saw them some time after they stopped working so I m definitely not sure what happened to them I just saw the results after several restarts 
A friend of mine gave me some old servers , and MSDN CD s from his paid for subscription years ago 
I have only ever used for testing , and always rebuilding / starting from scratch as you do when things go wrong 
Am i allowed to still use , i suspect the subscription has expired , and the OS i m using are 2008 so old 
Also If i was to sell on the server to a trainee for learning purposes , is this ok , or best just not including the MSDN software

For my PC / laptop ( windows ) , I personally use Dew VPN 
It s free 
I can also tell you , from personal experience I found it to be faster than other VPNs 
This is mostly due to the fact that is has so many servers worldwide , thus improving your chances of having your communications encrypted by a server that is near you 
Hope this helps

To use the 3d functionality of Photoshop , it requires 512 MB of VRAM 
However , my laptop only has 375 MB of VRAM , but 6 GB of RAM 
I tried increasing the amount through my BIOS , but there was no option to change it 
I also tried to use the Registry editor , but that method also did n't work 
Does anyone know a method to increase or fake an increase of VRAM so that I can pass the VRAM check of Photoshop ? wanting to change the colour of a cell on sheet2 to match that on sheet1 
the following code wor a macro works , but what i need now is for it to skip the first 44 rows on sheet2 before applying the backgroud colour selected in sheet1 
so row 45 sheet2 will match row1 sheet1 if that make sense ? I looked and looked but could not find a software that would preserve the footage from both ends in the recording 
I heard that maybe Zoom Pro does it when recording in the cloud , but I have no way to test it without actually paying for a subscription 
Does anybody have any suggestions ? Or do you believe it s impossible ? Thank you all for your time 
In order to remedy it we were trying to find a software that would allow us to not only record the interview , but keep the recorded version clean , regardless of whether or not our interviewee disconnected 
Moreover , we wanted to do it from our end 
That part is important because our subjects are quite old , important , and not exactly tech savvy 
So I ca n't really rely on them to install OBS , learn how to use it , and have them send us the files 
NLP , NLU , and NLG all play a part in teaching machines to think more like humans 
They simply tackle different parts of the conversational AI problem 
How do you get machines to recognize , understand , and generate natural language ? How do you use it to answer search queries and create content at scale ? Let ’s take a specific example to illustrate just how these functions work together 
You get home from work and wonder how your stocks did today 
After you tell your smart device to turn on your lights and crank up the heat , you ask , “ Hey Google , how did the stock market do today ? ” Your Google Home device listens to your query , and then NLP kicks in 
It takes your question and breaks it down into understandable pieces – “ stock market ” and “ today ” being keywords on which it focuses 
Then it compares your query to similar queries made to Google in general and tries to understand what you ’re asking 
That ’s NLU

I can restore the Windows 10 System Recovery Image from the network if I boot a Windows installer from a USB Stick 
8 
But I ca n't figure out how to do both ( boot the Windows Installer from the network on PXE and restore the system recovery image )

I even tried to have the recovery image and PXE server on different computers without any luck

Hello all , I m wondering if anyone would like to compare RPA products that are currently available 
I am aware of the mainstream ones like UiPath 
As someone who lived in China for some time I m also familiar with UiBot , the mainstream one used there 
I m wondering if anyone used both of these two before and can compare / analyze their strengths and weaknesses , or just a general discussion about these two 
Thanks ! As compared to all other programming languages , Python is broadly used by the developers because of several reasons 
Today , I am going to share some advantages of Python development 
The main advantages of Python languages are : it is easy to read as well as easy to learn 
Python language is better for automating build systems , collecting test data , server - side applications 
The main Python language advantages are that it is easy to read and easy to learn 
It is easier to write a program in Python than in C or C++ 
With this language , you gain the possibility to think clearly while coding , which also makes the code easier to sustain 
Which reduces the cost for maintenance of the program and seen as one of Python programming advantages 
An important advantage of Python language is that it has wide applicability , and is extensively used by scientists , engineers , and mathematicians 
It is for this reason that Python is so useful for prototyping and all kinds of experiments 
It is used in many groundbreaking fields 
It is also used when producing animation for movies and in machine learning 
I m looking for FREE application or software alternative to : TNM , Nmap , NetCrunch

you can use monitoring solution like Zabbix , it is not so easy to install and configure but it can do what you need 
Thank you for your answer , are you sure if Zabbix a software ? did n't see the download link for Windows OS 
Also , sure it s not easy to install , maybe i need VM with Linux or CentOS to try it ! ! !

Hello , I was wondering if it is possible in any way for someone to completely uninstall / remove the Microsoft Store that comes pre - installed with Windows 10 
I m saying completely , because it can either be restored through Windows Powershell or Command Prompt , but is it possible to remove the install package or something , in order for you to make the specific commands for restoring the Store not work , making the reinstall unfeasable ? It often happens that your downloaded videos are not playable on PC or portable devices 
What a frustrating situation ! More often than not , this problem might imply that your playable device is not compatible with original video format , which reminds you to do some extra conversion with professional converting software 
Hence , you will be more likely to search online for reliable software to convert MKV to MP4 
It is somewhat an act of dredging for a needle in the sea 
Any good solutions ? As I know , there are lots of free and online video converters in the market that you can use , like onlinevideoconverter , any video converter , etc 
If you do n't mind low - budget , I think you can use Joyoshare Video Converter 
It converts with 60X fast speed and supports multi - subtitle , muti - track videos 
I also use it to convert audios , DVDs , live photos 
Fast and lossless ! Maybe you can try to convert MKV to MP4 using some online converters , such as Zamzar , Convertio 
They are free and easy to use 
However , if your MKV files are large you can try Joyoshare Video Converter 
It can convert them without quality loss 
Also , VLC is a good option to encode video 
Apple is really famous for its proprietary software and the only software that Apple supports Windows I can find is iTunes 
However , the Windows iTunes is so heavy and clunky like a donkey 
It tries to load the app stubbornly on PC startup , and keeps running that really make me feel like crazy 
Even when I uncheck the " Open on Windows startup " and disable all Services that is related to iTunes , there is still something " Apple " there in the Task Manager that eats my RAM like a psycho 
Is this really Apple playing dirty on its competitor ? Further more , some of my friends complain that Shazam , a music recognition app owned by Apple , became terrible on Android since its acquisition by Apple 
Want to share the tools I used for recording screen on Windows , you may compare the pros and cons from the content below 
Meanwhile , I also would like to collect other great recorders from you guys 
Thanks ! Since personally I m more into web - based recorder , the online recorder part would be more detailed 
Different recorders offer a range of different features , can save captures in varying formats , or capture footage from external sources such as a webcam – and some even give you the opportunity to upload to the internet directly from within the program 
Some run nicely on average hardware , while others are more demanding 
The point is that there is plenty of choice 
1 
OBS Studio ; 2 
FlashBack Express ; 3 
Apowersoft Free Online Screen Recorder ; 4 
Debut Video Capture ; 5 
ShareX At our organization , we are using Keka HR for payroll management & it does work perfectly , even the UI is good , this is a complete suite which includes , attendance , leave , tax & all those stuff 
Apart from this , you can also try Adp , Oracle , etc 
I moved to the Note 9 
The stylus addition has allowed me to replace carrying around my Surface for work 
I still break out the S8 + when I stream music or need a flashlight when working in the warehouse 
OBS Studio supports both streaming and recording in high definition , with no restrictions on the number or length of your creations 
You can stream live to Twitch or YouTube gaming , save projects and come back to them later , or encode your footage in FLV format and save it locally 
Because OBS Studio can record directly from your graphics card , it ’s able to capture games running in full - screen mode ( many other screen recorders can only record if the game is windowed ) , with customizable hotkeys to control the recording 
OBS Studio can also make full use of multi - core CPUs for improved performance and can record at 60FPS ( or even higher ) 
I ve been trobueshooting something I ve been seeing for a few months 
A wireshark capture I ve been anaylyzing has some TCP out of order , Dup Ack s , and previous segment not captured 
Application works fine but not sure why I get these errors 
When I place the client and server on the same segment and right next to each other I still get the same errors 
I was told to uncheck the Analyze TCP sequence numbers and then all the errors disappeared from the pcap file 
They informed Wireshark has its own way of looking at the sequence numbers instead of using the raw sequence numbers from the pcap 
If I look at every wireshark capture file and have this option unchecked will wireshark disregard any errors it might potentially see
