Not bad performance
I m using an older 720p TV so pic quality is as good as it can get on the TV
I had to use the ATV with a wired connection - not sure if it can run on wireless network
There are some upgrades that can be done for better performance ( HD Crystal card ) and larger HD , but I figure by the time I invest more $ $ into this I could have bought a new Android / Kodi box for the same cost
I have tried several possibilities
I created a Sierra OS external drive and downgraded to iTunes 12.6.3.6
Tried to replace the " iTunes Library.itl " file from my current High Sierra iTunes 12.7.x in the iTunes 12.6.x folder but of course I got an error message that it was n't compatible with an earlier version , so ... I tried the Export Playlist / Import Playlist method ( Export Playlist from my current Mac OS and Import Playlist on my iTunes 12.6.x ) and was able to get all of my current iTunes media on to my iTunes 12.6.x
The only thing that seems to be different is the Apple TV icon at the top of the iTunes menu is missing , but clicking on my iPhone / iPad icon dropped down a menu with iPhone , iPad AND Apple TV
Now I can connect to my ATV1 , but still having problems with uploading photos and creating Screen Saver , etc
Home Sharing does work though
My next step is going to try downgrading iTunes 12.6.3.6 to 12.6.2002 and see if that helps
was their hardware and their support was n't as good as Dell
The XPS line of Dell is good but Lenovo seem to have better quality in the low price end
Well , I think that Apple is the best laptop brand
The laptops from this brand are really good to work on and are very smooth
But the cost of Apple laptops is on a higher side
In case , the budget is an issue then go with Dell
The brand manufactures durable and robust laptop with latest features They were not previously also
This year apple promised unbeliveble productivity with intel i9 , but after a some time the prodoctivity was falling ( trotling ) because of owerheating
So , no sense to pay extra
Nowadays only big fans of this brend are buying their products
