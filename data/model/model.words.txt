At its founding , Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices 
The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market , widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory 
Its first product , a quick entry into the small , high-speed memory market in 1969 , was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory ( SRAM ) , which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba , Japan 
In the same year , Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory ( ROM ) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) silicon gate SRAM chip , the 256-bit 1101 
While the 1101 was a significant advance , its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories 
The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , the 1103 released in 1970 solved these issues 
The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972 , as it replaced core memory in many applications 
Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products , still dominated by various memory devices 
Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor ( Intel 4004 ) in 1971 
The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry , as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer , which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do 
Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in 1973 
Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972 , in Malaysia , which would host multiple Intel operations , before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s , and manufacturing and development centres in China , India and Costa Rica in the 1990s 
By the early 1980s , its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) chips 
However , increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had , by 1983 , dramatically reduced the profitability of this market 
The growing success of the IBM personal computer , based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore ( CEO since 1975 ) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model 
Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success 
By the end of the 1980s , buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market , Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary ( and most profitable ) hardware supplier to the PC industry , part of the winning Wintel' combination 
Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987 
By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991 , Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection , so that by the end of the 1990s , its line of Pentium processors had become a household name 
In 2010 , Intel purchased McAfee , a manufacturer of computer security technology , for $7.68 billion

The Dutch PCM ( Personal Computer Magazine ) did a test in their April 2011 issue 
They took an image of one of their editorial PC s , which was one and a half years old and never optimized 
They compared a manual cleaning , using only standard Windows tools , with the results of a set of 9 tools by measuring startup time , shutdown time and speed according during the PCMark Vantage test 
The results summarized below are interesting 
They showed that some products actually slowed the system or increased the startup time 
One program ( see table below ) even manages to increase both the startup and the shutdown time and slowing the system at the same time 
On the positive site : they reported no problems with the system after running these tools 
After having some problems accessing shares across the platforms , I ve found that Acronis products as well as others can be at the root 
The cure seems to be something about increasing the IRPStackSize 
I ve Image 9 on one ( XP ) and 10 on another ( Win7 ) and receiving errors accessing XP shares from the Win7 machine until stumbling into this fix 
A google search will quickly find the regedit way to correct for this 
For me the size needed to be at least decimal 21 
Hope that helps someone out there 
I think you may be wrong with regard to the Speed test + 1.6 % surely means that it is quicker , otherwise System Mechanic would not have been given a best rating for + 3.6 % and PC Tools worst for - 3.1 % 
I love CCleaner 
I recommend it to all of my friends / family ( and by recommend I mean I install it on their machines and clean up without telling them ) 
However , a friend of mine is blind and it appears that JAWS ( 508 Compliance screen reader ) does not see all the objects in CCLeaner 
Can anyone recommend a FREE cleanup utility that JAWS will work with ? Also , once in a while a member will be very upset no one has a fix or alternate 
That s normal as it was noted in this area it breaks a YouTube agreement plus Google keeps changing how YouTube works so that app would need constant attention to keep working 
Greetings from the UK ! Whenever I open Microsoft Word , which I have as Word 365 , I almost always get a litany of error messages telling me that Word is unable to open various converters 
The programs listed include Excel , Lotus , Works , etc 
Which computer are you using ? Exact make and model , please 
If it s custom built which motherboard does it have ? Which operating system are you using ? Windows 10 Home ? Or Pro ? Windows 8.1 Home or Pro ? I have done the Chkdsk process ; one error was found and repaired , but Word is no better 
The only difference is that Adobe Reader DC stopped working and I had to restart to delete it from my system 
Samsung - PC ( Touch screen ) processor Intel i%-3470 T @2.90GHz RAM 6.00 GB 64-bit operating system , x64 based processor Windows 10 Home , Version 1903 
Addendum to earlier comment : I am using a MacPro , with the latest operating system always up to date 
The error messages claim to be looking for files in directories that do n't exist 
( Even the Microsoft techies could not find them anywhere on my computer 
) I suspect that this has something to do with the macros that I have written for these spreadsheets , but can not find anything in those macros that confirm that suspicion 
Are you referring to # 20 : Sabrent M.2 SSD to 2.5-Inch SATA III Aluminum Enclosure Adapter ( EC - M2SA ) ? Will go ahead with the UGREEN then just purchased now 
The Apricon was a bit expensive 
Look like the software is the main price here I think ? Works out cheaper for me if I move my data to external matching HDD to SSD 
Then Clone it , then replace HDD with new SDD 
Shortly after will copying the data to the new HDD 
Cool , problem solved well only that by matching the HDD and SSD using any of the cloning software 
Hmm do n't want to get my hopes until it actually clone first ? I am missing something ? The Macrium or MiniTools are saying too small to clone for my 240 gb SSD 
Are you saying the Apricon removes those restrictions and clone whether big or small e.g Cloning 500 gb HDD to 240 gb SSD ? Not sure what you are implying ? I m almost done with my data transfer so I hope it works 
When I select the SIGNATURES button in Outlook 2016 , nothing happens 
i ve tried numerous solutions such as checking if I have Office 365 apps installed ( I did n't ) and quick and full Office repair 
Did n't work 
Any ideas ? Create a new user account then log into that ( Windows User accounts , use and more are in many articles 
) Test and see if it s a system wide issue
