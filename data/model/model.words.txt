At its founding , Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices 
The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market , widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory 
Its first product , a quick entry into the small , high-speed memory market in 1969 , was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory ( SRAM ) , which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba , Japan 
In the same year , Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory ( ROM ) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) silicon gate SRAM chip , the 256-bit 1101 
While the 1101 was a significant advance , its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories 
The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , the 1103 released in 1970 solved these issues 
The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972 , as it replaced core memory in many applications 
Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products , still dominated by various memory devices 
Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor ( Intel 4004 ) in 1971 
The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry , as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer , which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do 
Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in 1973 
Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972 , in Malaysia , which would host multiple Intel operations , before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s , and manufacturing and development centres in China , India and Costa Rica in the 1990s 
By the early 1980s , its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) chips 
However , increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had , by 1983 , dramatically reduced the profitability of this market 
The growing success of the IBM personal computer , based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore ( CEO since 1975 ) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model 
Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success 
By the end of the 1980s , buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market , Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary ( and most profitable ) hardware supplier to the PC industry , part of the winning Wintel' combination 
Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987 
By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991 , Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection , so that by the end of the 1990s , its line of Pentium processors had become a household name 
In 2010 , Intel purchased McAfee , a manufacturer of computer security technology , for $7.68 billion 
As a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction , Intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel chips and personal computers 
After the acquisition , Intel had about 90 employees , including about 12 software engineers 
In September 2016 , Intel sold a majority stake in its computer-security unit to TPG Capital , reversing the five-year-old McAfee acquisition 
In August 2010 , Intel and Infineon Technologies announced that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business 
Intel planned to use Infineon's technology in laptops , smart phones , netbooks , tablets and embedded computers in consumer products , eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel silicon chips 
In March 2011 , Intel bought most of the assets of Cairo-based SySDSoft 
In July 2011 , Intel announced that it had agreed to acquire Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. , a company specializing in network switches 
The company used to be included on the EE Times list of 60 Emerging Startups 
In October 2011 , Intel reached a deal to acquire Telmap , an Israeli-based navigation software company 
The purchase price was not disclosed , but Israeli media reported values around $300 million to $350 million
