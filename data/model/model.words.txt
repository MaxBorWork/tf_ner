At its founding , Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices 
The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market , widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory 
Its first product , a quick entry into the small , high-speed memory market in 1969 , was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory ( SRAM ) , which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba , Japan 
In the same year , Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory ( ROM ) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) silicon gate SRAM chip , the 256-bit 1101 
While the 1101 was a significant advance , its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories 
The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) , the 1103 released in 1970 solved these issues 
The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972 , as it replaced core memory in many applications 
Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products , still dominated by various memory devices 
Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor ( Intel 4004 ) in 1971 
The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry , as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer , which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do 
Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in 1973 
Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972 , in Malaysia , which would host multiple Intel operations , before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s , and manufacturing and development centres in China , India and Costa Rica in the 1990s 
By the early 1980s , its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ) chips 
However , increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had , by 1983 , dramatically reduced the profitability of this market 
The growing success of the IBM personal computer , based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore ( CEO since 1975 ) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model 
Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success 
By the end of the 1980s , buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market , Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary ( and most profitable ) hardware supplier to the PC industry , part of the winning Wintel' combination 
Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987 
By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991 , Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection , so that by the end of the 1990s , its line of Pentium processors had become a household name 
In 2010 , Intel purchased McAfee , a manufacturer of computer security technology , for $7.68 billion

As of January 2013 , Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google . Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8 , According to J.D.Howard , a vice president at Lenovo s mobile division , the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand 
In 2012 , Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan 
ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture 
Akaemi Watanabe , president of Lenovo Japan , said , " As a Japanese , I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full - scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers 
The Dutch PCM ( Personal Computer Magazine ) did a test in their April 2011 issue 
They took an image of one of their editorial PC s , which was one and a half years old and never optimized 
They compared a manual cleaning , using only standard Windows tools , with the results of a set of 9 tools by measuring startup time , shutdown time and speed according during the PCMark Vantage test 
The results summarized below are interesting 
They showed that some products actually slowed the system or increased the startup time 
One program ( see table below ) even manages to increase both the startup and the shutdown time and slowing the system at the same time 
On the positive site : they reported no problems with the system after running these tools 
After having some problems accessing shares across the platforms , I ve found that Acronis products as well as others can be at the root 
The cure seems to be something about increasing the IRPStackSize 
I ve Image 9 on one ( XP ) and 10 on another ( Win7 ) and receiving errors accessing XP shares from the Win7 machine until stumbling into this fix 
A google search will quickly find the regedit way to correct for this 
For me the size needed to be at least decimal 21 
Hope that helps someone out there 
I think you may be wrong with regard to the Speed test + 1.6 % surely means that it is quicker , otherwise System Mechanic would not have been given a best rating for + 3.6 % and PC Tools worst for - 3.1 % 
I love CCleaner 
I recommend it to all of my friends / family ( and by recommend I mean I install it on their machines and clean up without telling them ) 
However , a friend of mine is blind and it appears that JAWS ( 508 Compliance screen reader ) does not see all the objects in CCLeaner 
Can anyone recommend a FREE cleanup utility that JAWS will work with ? Also , once in a while a member will be very upset no one has a fix or alternate 
That s normal as it was noted in this area it breaks a YouTube agreement plus Google keeps changing how YouTube works so that app would need constant attention to keep working 
Greetings from the UK ! Whenever I open Microsoft Word , which I have as Word 365 , I almost always get a litany of error messages telling me that Word is unable to open various converters 
The programs listed include Excel , Lotus , Works , etc 
Which computer are you using ? Exact make and model , please 
If it s custom built which motherboard does it have ? Which operating system are you using ? Windows 10 Home ? Or Pro ? Windows 8.1 Home or Pro ? I have done the Chkdsk process ; one error was found and repaired , but Word is no better 
The only difference is that Adobe Reader DC stopped working and I had to restart to delete it from my system 
Samsung - PC ( Touch screen ) processor Intel i%-3470 T @2.90GHz RAM 6.00 GB 64-bit operating system , x64 based processor Windows 10 Home , Version 1903 
Addendum to earlier comment : I am using a MacPro , with the latest operating system always up to date 
The error messages claim to be looking for files in directories that do n't exist 
( Even the Microsoft techies could not find them anywhere on my computer 
) I suspect that this has something to do with the macros that I have written for these spreadsheets , but can not find anything in those macros that confirm that suspicion 
Are you referring to # 20 : Sabrent M.2 SSD to 2.5-Inch SATA III Aluminum Enclosure Adapter ( EC - M2SA ) ? Will go ahead with the UGREEN then just purchased now 
The Apricon was a bit expensive 
Look like the software is the main price here I think ? Works out cheaper for me if I move my data to external matching HDD to SSD 
Then Clone it , then replace HDD with new SDD 
Shortly after will copying the data to the new HDD 
Cool , problem solved well only that by matching the HDD and SSD using any of the cloning software 
Hmm do n't want to get my hopes until it actually clone first ? I am missing something ? The Macrium or MiniTools are saying too small to clone for my 240 gb SSD 
Are you saying the Apricon removes those restrictions and clone whether big or small e.g Cloning 500 gb HDD to 240 gb SSD ? Not sure what you are implying ? I m almost done with my data transfer so I hope it works 
When I select the SIGNATURES button in Outlook 2016 , nothing happens 
i ve tried numerous solutions such as checking if I have Office 365 apps installed ( I did n't ) and quick and full Office repair 
Did n't work 
Any ideas ? Create a new user account then log into that ( Windows User accounts , use and more are in many articles 
) Test and see if it s a system wide issue
That s bigger
But a x pixel character is smaller , so you might prefer other settings for zoom in your browser and for scaling in Windows
You re right , 23.8 for Lenovo versus 24.1 for Dell
I d love to see them side - by - side but I ca n't do that as I m 90-minutes away from a Staples or BestBuy
Is the difference in PPI , 103 versus 123 a noticeable difference ? I decided against the Lenovo because of the glossy screen and disappointed in the 94 PPI for the 2415 so spent $ 40 more for the Dell - P2421D
It s 123 PPI , see specs
Hi , I m on Windows 10 , and this is a new issue that s popped up in the past few days
I have two external hard drive disks - previously , when I deleted files , they would send them to the recycle bin
Now though , they no longer do so , and only ask me if I want to get rid of them permanently , like on a USB stick
This is an issue because if I ever accidentally delete a file , I want to be able to recover it immediately
This could have to do with the fact that one of my hard drives fell down lightly the other day ( though it is strange , because they re otherwise working perfectly fine , and this also affects the one that did n't fall )
When I click on the Recycle Bin properties , its only location is my internal C : drive - I assume it s supposed to have the other drives as well ? Is there a way to add them back ? I ve tried unplugging and plugging them back in , to no avail
As I understand it , each external HDD has a specific hidden " recycle bin " that is linked to the desktop recycle bin
Both of them still had these , though I deleted one , to see if that changed anything , because I thought I read that if I unplugged and plugged the HDD back in it would recreate it ( which , uh , it did n't )
I tried chkdsk and scannow on one of the drives , but not both of them
Since both are exhibiting the same behavior , I m mostly making tests on the one containing less data
So now I m kinda stumped
I have no idea if there s a way to fix this , and searching online gave me no real clue - most posts are about deleting the external HDD recycle bins , which obviously is not what I want
I m in the process of buying upgrades for my h9 - 1460ea gaming PC , and I ve sorted my RAM upgrades so it s utilising the maximum 32 GB rather than the original 6 GB
I d appreciate some guidance on upgrading the graphics card and SSD ; it still has the GTX 660 it came with , but I m not particularly knowledgeable about GPUs
I ve heard the GTX 1060 is a good upgrade for it and fits the case etc
, but I ve noticed its power requirements are 400W and my PC runs on 600W ; does this make a difference , and therefore will I also need a new power supply ? And in terms of the SSD , it still has the original 128 GB SSD , but I plan on also upgrading this to at least a 500 GB or 1 TB upgrade from Crucial , but I m unsure if there s anything else I need to account for
I went through a very old Quad Core desktop and in the end used the GTX 1060
Please read https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/im-upgrading-some-old-iron-what-would-you-like/ where I took it step by step PLUS used a Watt meter at each step to see if I was overtaxing the rather small power supply
In short , if your power supply is a single rail of either 400 or 600 Watts it will be fine
If you want me to check out the PSU about it being single rail just supply the make and model number and hopefully I can find the specs
If not post a picture on say Imgur.com of the specs on the PSU side panel for me to look at
Currently I ca n't look at the power supply of the PC as it s at home ( I m a student just graduating from uni ; will be back at home around the 20th of June )
I ve checked on the HP site for PC specs but they only specify the type of power supply it is instead of the model / make i.e. Internal ATX form factor , Total wattage : 600W , Nominal input voltage range : 100 - 127V ( 50 - 60Hz)/200 - 240V ( 50 - 60Hz ) , 2 PCI - E Power Connectors
Just opened up the casing , for some reason I ca n't link a photo of the PSU but the model number is : DPS-600WBA
I also looked into the physical dimensions of the GTX 1060 and I can just about physically fit it into the case
Thanks again for any advice ! I just checked System Information on my PC and it does say that my BIOS mode is UEFI ; does that mean I can actually use a better graphics card like the 1660 Bob__B suggested ? The price of the GTX 1060 is higher than the 1660 , but there are some differences ; the 1060 is a 6 pin connection to the PSU while the 1660 is 8 pin , and there are also several variations of the 1660 i.e. GTX 1660 ti , GTX 1660 super , ASUS GTX 1660 etc
Very confusing to know which one is best to go for at this point , but that being said the standard 1660 seems remarkably smaller physically than the 1060 - considering the h9 - 1460ea case is relatively small , it would be preferable to save as much space whilst getting the best possible option simultaneously
I see various answers to the 6-pin and 8-pin dilemma , but if my PSU already has an 8-pin connector installed with the GTX 660 it came with should I not stick with that in case I get a 6-pin and it does n't function properly ? Like I said previously , I have little to no knowledge about PC components , so many of the google links you provided that discuss it talk about the voltage and ground parts of the cables from the PSU to the graphics card - all of which goes straight over my head and does n't actually help me narrow it down as all the answers seems to differ
I have a 2017 iMac running High Sierra and my Magic Mouse 2 ( lithium - ion battery charged via Lightning plug ) bought at the same time no longer connects
When I click on the " Connect " button , the display shows " Connected " and immediately switches to " Not connected "
Nothing I do has fixed this
Have a stock of blank CDs but have forgotten how to record on them
They are imation brand , CD - R , 700m/80 min
Compatible with all drives from 1x to 52x
Can somebody tell me where to start ? My computer details : macOS High Sierra , version 10.13.6 , iMac , Retina 4K.
Processor 3,1 GHz Intel Core i5 , Memory 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3
The amount of memory depends on the size of the data and how much space is used for calculations
100 million rows of 100 bytes are just 10 GB
That would leave 118 GB for OS , program and work space
Might be more than needed
Here also , ask the maker for advice and run a benchmark comparing , say , 32 , 64 and 128 GB
I m going to skip any mention of PRAM resets and keys you hold down during power up or your Apple
To be an owner of a legacy product I think you would have those burned into long term memory or a cheat sheet
the replacement of the optical drive in any of the G4 laptops is certainly not for the faint of heart
I presume that the computer would n't boot statement refers to you trying to boot the computer from the optical drive using a Mac OSX Installation disk
If that is not the case , and your computer does not boot at all , there is a 99 % chance that it has gone to join the choir invisible
shuffled off this mortal coil , bereft of life , gone to meet its maker ( aplogies to Monty P ) Step 17 of the ifixit procedure carries a dire warning
With 20/20 hindsight , perhaps a better fix for the problem on this ageing laptop , between 13 and 18 years old , would have been a Firewire Optical drive or even a USB one
to be honest , I think you are attached to another object by an inclined plane , wrapped helically around an axis
I recently just bought an iMac G5 20 ” , 1 GB , 250 GB Mid 2005 model ( I think ) from a flee market
I knew it was defective , but thought that I could fix it or use it as decoration at worst
The iMac has graphical errors at boot up , but the OS system loads fine
Everything in the background works even the DVD ( tested with a DVD film )
Sound works and it seems just fine , but the screen is all screwed up with checkerboards and graphical errors all over the place
I can not read what is stated on the screen
Not bad performance
I m using an older 720p TV so pic quality is as good as it can get on the TV
I had to use the ATV with a wired connection - not sure if it can run on wireless network
There are some upgrades that can be done for better performance ( HD Crystal card ) and larger HD , but I figure by the time I invest more $ $ into this I could have bought a new Android / Kodi box for the same cost
I have tried several possibilities
I created a Sierra OS external drive and downgraded to iTunes 12.6.3.6
Tried to replace the " iTunes Library.itl " file from my current High Sierra iTunes 12.7.x in the iTunes 12.6.x folder but of course I got an error message that it was n't compatible with an earlier version , so ... I tried the Export Playlist / Import Playlist method ( Export Playlist from my current Mac OS and Import Playlist on my iTunes 12.6.x ) and was able to get all of my current iTunes media on to my iTunes 12.6.x
The only thing that seems to be different is the Apple TV icon at the top of the iTunes menu is missing , but clicking on my iPhone / iPad icon dropped down a menu with iPhone , iPad AND Apple TV
Now I can connect to my ATV1 , but still having problems with uploading photos and creating Screen Saver , etc
Home Sharing does work though
My next step is going to try downgrading iTunes 12.6.3.6 to 12.6.2002 and see if that helps
was their hardware and their support was n't as good as Dell
The XPS line of Dell is good but Lenovo seem to have better quality in the low price end
Well , I think that Apple is the best laptop brand
The laptops from this brand are really good to work on and are very smooth
But the cost of Apple laptops is on a higher side
In case , the budget is an issue then go with Dell
The brand manufactures durable and robust laptop with latest features They were not previously also
This year apple promised unbeliveble productivity with intel i9 , but after a some time the prodoctivity was falling ( trotling ) because of owerheating
So , no sense to pay extra
Nowadays only big fans of this brend are buying their products
And about previous years
They were 1st because of statistic
For example from 100 laptops was sold 20 apple , 19 ASUS , 11 Lenovo , 19 Dell , 18 Microsoft and 12 MSI
It shows that 80 % with Windows was sold and 20 % with macOS
+ Depends from the country
I ve got an hp notebook 17-x115dx
The images devices is not showing up on my Device Manager on Windows 10
Apparently , my webcam is not showing up
All of my updates including BIOS is downloaded including Windows 10 are already installed
I did scan hardware changes and nothing happens
I ve used the HP Support and went on their website to look for the drivers and i can not find anything
Can anyone send me a direct link where I can download the right drivers for the built in camera , thanks
Hi I ’ve bought Lenovo s540GTX series recently
I have problem with its USB - A ( 3.1VER ) ports
When I connect my WD Element external drive to any of them , it takes a while more than usual to recognize the drive
Moreover , it s transferring speed is below 40 MB / s
Also , when the drive is connected , my Internet connection will stop working
I did n’t have these problems with another drives
It would be better to say this , I thought that It might my external drive has problem but I tested it on Asus UX501vw Laptop and it worked properly
So , anyone has any idea what should I do ! ? which is more of an example is a motherboard ( I ca n't be sure if it s the right one for yours ) which costs just under 60 USD so that s a deal since the shop counter charge here starts at 150 USD plus parts
Hello everyone , I am looking for a new battery for my Yuanpeng YEPO 737S , the part number is H-3885265P , my previous battery capacity is 8000MAH , I am preparing to buy it online , and seeing that it is 10000MAH online , different capacity will affect Use it ? This is my first discussion here and I wanted to ask which one of these two laptops are better for college and mediocere gaming use : FX531GT - BQ400 T ( i7 - 9750 , fhd 15.6 , 16 gb ddr4 ram , 512 ssd m.2 , gtx 1650 )
FX505GM - AL340 T ( i7 - 9750 , fhd 15.6 , 8 gb ddr4 2666 ram , SSD 128Gb + HDD 1Tb , gtx 1060 )
The Asus TUF FX505GM has a more powerful gtx 1060 vs the Asus Rog FX531GT that has gtx 1650 but the Asus Rog will last longer
As the Asus Rog has a more robust chassis and it looks better too
I use bog standard 2.5 laptop size SSDs
Now once in a while you ll have a client that demands a compatibility check
For them you go to Crucial.com for both RAM and SSD
Otherwise you can shop from an abundant selection of SATA 2.5 inch laptop drives
I have an Acer Aspire A515 - 51 G and I want some opinions before I upgrade my RAM
I was wondering if anyone out there could help me out
I m looking for the drivers for an HDR - FX7 Mini DV camera
I m using Windows 10 and Vegas 16 Pro
It had worked in the past but the Device Manager did not see the camera , my firewire card is working
I downloaded the FAM drivers off of the Sony site and it now sees the camera but there are no drivers available to operate the camera so I can move the video from the camera to the computer for processing
Any ideas would be welcome
I have a Panasonic Palmcorder PV - IQ403 that I want to take on vacation soon
The recording seems fine , it s just the VCR function
It s a very odd problem that wo n't seem to go away
Whenever I play back video , the speed of playback switches from " SP " mode to " SLP " mode every 3 to 5 seconds
This causes the video to go from slightly sped - up at times to downright headache inducing
I do n't believe it s the tapes fault , but I could be wrong
Seeing as how this is the only VCR I own ( and the only one within 3000 miles that takes VHS - C ) , I want this thing working
I m on a mission to convert all my family s old videos from our tapes to digital so they re better safeguarded
I started this project with a camcorder we already had to convert VHS - c tapes using Honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 software and that worked perfectly
I just purchased a used Sharp Viewcam VL - E620u and am trying to convert my 8 mm tapes , but I m having a problem where the video looks fine when you view it from the camcorder itself , but when I try to convert it using my Honestech program the video goes black and white
I m hoping for any tips , as I m completely lost and am so frustrated
Thank you in advance ! What I m Using : Sharp Viewcam VL - E620u Laptop with Windows 10 The converter that came with the Honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 program Cable that came with camcorder , it has a yellow and white plug on one end and a single black plug on the other that plugs into the camcorder
The battery that s in the camcorder is a power charger adapter where it plugs into the wall outlet
I read this in a similar model by that maker : " This product incorporates copyright protection technology that is protected by method claims of certain U.S. patents and other intellectual property rights owned by Macrovision Corporation and other rights owners
" I have avoided this by using a DVR or a VHS recorder
My favorite tool in digitizing is not a PC
it s this thing
But remember that in your case it s never the same thing so I admit I ll try this , that and something else till it works
Again , if you have but one digitizer then eventually it wo n't do the job
Does anyone have a battery for a Panasonic PV - GS29 mini camcorder ? Check with the User Manual
I think the battery is the CGR - DU06 which is still available

Currently Apex Legends released
This game looks really good , i charged keys from to plays a few days when I get back from school
Apex save the world all i play now .. Similar fornite the number one game , Fortnite is too sweaty these days , it s hard to actually enjoy the game anymore
Apex legends is the best thing that could ve happened to fortnite
Epic might finally have some competition and that could encourage them to improve their game
They need to add seasons and battle pass like in fortnite ASAP or a lot of people will go back to fortnite
New season soon so it d be good if they d add it either this month or wait until season 8 fortnite cools down
both games are my favorite games but I think apex legends better then fortine because of it graphics apex legends graphics much better than fortine , both games are battel royal games , however , fortine not a better than apex legends there are many battel royal games available and pubg is more popular than fortine and apex legends
apex legends were released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 4 , 2019 , and fortine released for PlayStation 4 , Nintendo Switch , Android , Xbox One , iOS , Microsoft Windows , Macintosh operating systems in 2017
Fortnite is a very popular game of 2017 - 2018 and developed by Epic Games , epic games are very popular gaming company which have launched more than thouasand games
And Flash memory the answer to " can anyone " has to be yes
While there may be a handful of folk that can get in that deep the real issue is what s in that cloud which is more likely to leak than a factory reset console with the HDD you used
I m going to just say it since it will take too long to write this softly
If you feel this is what is needed , then do it but I consider it foolish to remove the HDD given all the other means of data access
AGAIN , do the factory resets and drive clearing
Then move on
Picture settings tested : CNET is no longer publishing advanced picture settings for any TVs we review
Instead , we ll give more general recommendations to get the best picture without listing the detailed white balance or color management system ( CMS ) settings we may have used to calibrate the TV
As always , the settings provided are a guidepost , and if you want the most accurate picture you should get a professional calibration
Before calibration the Cinema and preset was the most accurate , excellent in terms of grayscale and gamma with just a slight reddish cast toward brighter areas ( but still within my error target of delta 3 )
Since I now target a 2.2 gamma for my reviews dark rooms it was closer than ISF Expert Dark or the new Filmmaker modes , which both target gamma 2.4 / BT 1886
ISF Bright was basically identical to Cinema but I reserved that for brighter rooms
For my calibration I tweaked the two - point grayscale to remove the red cast , reduced light output to my target of 137 nits and increased brightness two pips to help with shadow detail ( while still keeping perfect black levels ) but otherwise left well enough alone
The grayscale and color were already so accurate on my LG - provided review sample that I did n't need to touch the multipoint system or the color management system
SDR dark room settings : Picture Mode Settings : Cinema , Aspect Ratio Settings : 16:9 ( Just Scan : On ) , Energy Saving : Off
HDR Notes : HDR Cinema and Filmmaker mode were basically identical , following the EOTF quite closely and better than both Cinema Home
Color checker was a bit less - accurate than on the C9 from last year but not bad , and as usual with OLED the set covered P3 HDR gamut very well
The CX also measured dimmer than the C9 , coming closer in peak brightness ( both accurate and inaccurate settings ) to the B9
Once again the TV automatically detected and engaged the " HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color " setting designed for HDR sources
I m curious why CNET opted to stop posting the details of the calibration settings ? These were tremendously useful ! I have 3 TV s in my house right now that date back more than 15 years , and I have all 3 CNET postings which give the detailed specs bookmarked and always available on a web page in my phone
I am trying to set up a video wall with 2x2 LG 47 " flat screens , each with 2 K resolution , in order to have one 4 K display distributed on all four screens
I am using the AMD Radeon RX570 graphics adapter with support for up to 5 screens
All screens are connected properly ( one with native HDMI the other three with Display port - HDMI adapters )
All screens are working properly and shows parts of the windows image
Eyefinity is activated , but for some reason I may only arrange the screens as four screens side by side , but not as a 2x2 matrix
I am running Windows 10 and the standard dialog for screen rearrangement does not allow me to move the screen symbols to a 2x2 matrix , neither the interface of the graphic card settings ( Eyefinity )
What do I need to change ? I have an LG OLED TV ( 55B7A )
Prior to buying an Apple TV 4k , we were using the built - in Netflix and Amazon Prime apps to watch shows with no complaints
Once we connected the Apple TV , however , we started getting what I ve since learned is called the " soap opera " effect
It looks like we re watching a B - movie , or like we re watching a cheap video recording of people on a set
I did some research and found articles explaining how to disable this effect in the LG TV settings
I turned off " TruMotion " , noise reduction , and all other " features " that could contribute to this
However , we re still seeing the effect
And we did n't have it prior to hooking up the Apple TV
This tells me that there must be a setting or settings in Apple TV that are contributing
What can I do to turn it off ? At this point , my wife and I actually prefer to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime on my MacBook Pro or iPad Pro because we HATE the soap opera effect so much
I m really hoping there s some way to turn it off ! Because this model shipped in 2014 you are looking at a model 5 or more years old and the LCD and backlight has aged and shifted in color so any calibration you find on the web would be for a new 2014 TV and not one with this many years on it
I d go for self calibration instead for this reason
Here s CNET and Rtings on that
So I d go over all the settings , and connections
For the home button to work ( Sky remote ) then the HDMI CeC function must work
You can find failed HDMI cables and owners that moved the HDMI cables around so you re never sure if it s simple or will need a new board in the TV or another cable box
Error after OS Update

Thanks for the help I have found both the Acer 14 and the Lenovo S330 for reasonable prices online
Which one of the Chromebooks would be best for a student ? Basically you shop on CPU , RAM , display and keyboard quality
As I found multiple models in each series I ca n't begin to compare
We ll use the Chromebooks till they stop working
I think one of them has n't been updated for years yet it s working
As to your question , it s going to upset some that you replace the Chromebook when the updates stop
Or look around to see if you can install Linux then run Chrome there
Google has been prepping a new operating system outside the duo of Chrome OS and Android ( both running on the Linux kernel ) , named Fuchsia , but it s not clear if the tech giant had any intention of replacing them anytime soon
Google announced Fuchsia in August 2016 , which is a digression from its tradition of running OSes on Linus and perhaps to serve as an operating system for embedded hardware , especially in the case of embedded devices like car dashboards or GPS units , as the Linux kernel can impact performance and may cause some problems
Albeit , the rumor that Google has been preparing a new unified operating system to replace Chrome OS ( for Chromebooks ) and Android ( for smartphones ) , is pretty back dated already
Fuchsia is based on a kernel called Zircon ( formerly known as “ Magenta ” ) , which was originally to serve as an OS for embedded systems due to its “ real - time ” processes
Though it could theoretically run on any kind of device , such as IoT devices , ATMs , Wearables , even smartphones , tablets and desktops , including all devices powered by ARM and Intel processors
The new OS which is still in its early developmental stage has garnered support for Apple ’s Swift programming language , adding to several other languages already supported
So now that it s techtober and the current date is Oct 15 which is also MadeByGoogle day , it is clear that ChromeOS is n't going away
I would n't say Google has a successful launch of their first Pixelbook device , but they absolutely did with their OS in other separately branded devices
Now they have decided to create a less ambitious device with the Pixelbook Go
A regular , moderately priced , hardshell laptop
I m currently typing this on a MacBook Air with my Pixelbook right beside me , and I can personally say that the Pixelbook Go is much more Mac - esque than it is Pixelbook - esque
I know I will be getting my hands on it as soon as possible , and will also be using that pretty new Pixel 4 s camera to record some interesting footage
But back to the question , I think that ChromeOS is here to stay , but the success of this device might decide for how long
I have a Laptop that does not allow Boot from a " Caddied " Disk
I keep all my data , media , and other personal stuff in the internal drive , and the OSes are in the caddied drive - Windows ( 2 ) , Linux ( 3 )
To permit booting from the Caddied drive , I have a small Linux Distro in the Internal drive that gives me the option to choose the OS I want to boot from , by editing the GRUB
My question is , can I have just the bare GRUB ( instead of the full Linux Distro ) that can do the same ? If so , how do I go about it ? currently I have windows 10 installed on a cheap 32 GB ASUS laptop
I no longer have enough room on my laptop to update the system or even use fresh start- I ve uninstalled every app and deleted every unnecessary file , but I still need more room because windows is so huge
I ve used Linux Mint on another laptop in the past but someone else installed it for me through a cd
but my laptop does not have a cd drive
You may need to install a different terminal to make it reliable ( I had to install Guake ) The good thing is though , Linux distro s have real people who will actually help you , often giving you everything in a way you just need to copy and paste
Due to this and not getting constant run around when I do have a problem , I stopped using Win10 in October 2017
The problem with Linux forums is .. good luck getting in number one and you could be weeks awaiting an answer
I ve used Linux in one form or another for quite a few years and have generally been able to resolve issues on my own without the aid of a forum
Mint is the first distro that I have had issues with updates , I do n't recall this type of problem with Ubuntu / Kubuntu
Oh well , push come to shove .. format and reload
The new distro upgrade is due out sometime in June you might want to wait and give that a try
I m going to run the new variant , which supposedly is Mint 20 , on a system as a test before I go all out
I do n't blame you for going back to Kubuntu , at least for now
The only issues I have had with Linux have been Since the inception of 19 , there have been a few issues
My Linux systems are dedicated , I dual booted for years but decided to dedicate a couple of systems to Linux and a couple to Windows and for the most part Linux has worked out well , aside from a couple of burps
Windows , over the years , has given me way more headaches than has Linux
Good luck ... Hey , Thank you for your reply
I have always had struggles with the Boot mode and secure boot settings as it does not allow me to change them , however , the boot mode is set to UEFI and the secure boot mode is disabled
I took it to a tech
awhile hack to have ubuntu installed and they mentioned something about the kernel is a problem so they had to install ubuntu 16.04 , however , since then this laptop no longer has any OS running
The link you provided is for the E 15 , however , mine is an ES 15
Since you ca n't disable the UEFI and move to a classic BIOS then all bets are off this will ever run on this laptop
I provided the link because it was the clearest response I ve seen about disabling UEFI on the Acers
If you ca n't do this then as it stands this laptop is currently incompatible with this OS
Wo n't be the first time , wo n't be the last
after rereading your post , it brought back awful memories of problems I had with the kernel and most other linux distros on a couple of my computers
They would do exactly what you are describing
It had something to do with the kernal and the video adapter
there was some change in the kernal that affected the video
sometimes I could get linux installed in compatibility mode and change the video driver to a third party one
the only real fix was installing an even older version of linux or going back to win7
Hello there I have an IBM type machine and a CD with linux mint O / S on it
I put the CD in the machine and boot from CD but I am brough up a running O / S running off of the CD
I do nt so any options of installing it onto my HDD First of all , if you use an Android phone or perhaps have a Facebook account , you can stop worrying now , as you can rest assured that Google has taken away more of your privacy than Windows 10 ever will
Also do keep in mind that a lot of people , including government agencies and large corporations all around the world , do get by with Windows 10 so far
Please note ! this app is NOT meant to watch or stream any movies and tv shows
" I can hardly call that a movie player like Netflix
I m afraid the OP means the APK with a space in the name that shows all the latest high - quality TV shows and movies ( without mentioning any country , so probably from all countries )
Did you find that in the store ? but I ca n't see your full screen where on the desktop top left would be the usual Computer , Home and Install Linux Mint
I m left with no way to test your distro
I am very passionate about watching football channels
Recently , the ThopTV application is being used by a lot of people to watch movies and TV channels for free so I would love to install it too
Now I want to ask you how to install ThopTv for android ? I bought an unlocked Galaxy S20 and put it on the Good2Go Mobile n / w ( uses AT&T ’s n / w )
Apparently I ’m unable to use wifi calling on G2 G ’s n / w because of AT&T restrictions
Question : what if I bought an AT&T locked phone and then unlocked it – would I be able to use the wifi calling feature on the G2 G n / w ? The IMEI would ( should ? ? ) be registered w / AT&T … wondering if this would work or if AT&T would again block the feature since it would not be directly on their network
The issue is that the Wifi calling is considered a premium service and not supported on Good2Go Mobile
They do not own their own network or towers and merely lease network access
The solution is to start a monthly plan on At&t and not a prepaid / MVNO
You could port your current phone
Thanks your advice R Proffit
Ironically , I use Google Voice w / my home phone ; I have an Obihai VOIP system that I set up many years ago and it s worked very well
I ve also considered installing a picocell in my house but from what I ve read , they re all carrier - specific , which would lock me into one of the large carriers , such as AT&T. I m with Good2Go Mobile for two reasons : 1 ) CHEAP ! $ 20/ mo for 3 G of data and unlimited talk/ text
( I m retired so I need to watch how I spend my shekels ) 2 ) they use ATT s n / w which covers my physical home location - I m WAY out in the country and TMobile , Sprint or VZW do n't have " adequate " service Hi , I ’m new to this site
Firstly I do n’t know if I ’m on the right page here , but could anyone please kindly help me
I ’ve been using an app on my phone I ’ve had it a week now it worked fine and all of a sudden I keep getting a message saying that VPN is detected , I do n’t have this and do n’t even know how to use this , however if I use my phone with the app on a different network like in Asda store it works without no problems and no VPN Detection
Could anyone please help or alternatively direct me to any kind of forums or any other forms of help
Much appreciated .. Hi , thanks for getting back to me
Is it possible then that my internet provider has put a VPN on my network because I was under the impression that this was something that you have to do yourself
The certain app I use will not open on my home network but if I try and use it for example in a WiFi hotspot like a shopping centre with free WiFi it works with no problem
Is there away that I would be able to tell if my network has had this VPN put on with out me knowing
Thanks again I have a photo collection of different genres , I want to edit it to make my collection perfect but I m not good at photoshop

While this can edit animated pictures there is no support for that on Android
As to other pictures you can have a jpeg , png or many others as wallpaper so their is nothing new to cover here about setting an image as wallpaper on Android

Hello everyone , today I have just installed the new version of netflix apk 7.53.2 on my samsung note9 phone
I do not know how to turn off audio description on netflix
Does anybody know ? Help me
Thanks everyone
The first time I got the message it did give me a update yo install
I installed it and it changed my whole phone
Even after that i ve still been receiving the same text
Just no software update
What can I do to uninstall the update or whatever it is to get my phone back to normal ? I , too , have a ZTE phone from Safelink and have been getting these texts since at least January - but in the last month or so they ve been coming in a couple times a week
That s what made me suspicious enough to Google it , which led me here
I m mortified and ashamed to admit I ve just been texting " Install " each time ... any suggestions to make sure I have n't done anything horrible ? Sometimes avoiding OS updates can prevent certain applications from working properly on the device when the developer no longer offers backward support for older Android versions
Got ta weigh both options
Personally I did n't hesitate to update my Samsung Galaxy S9 + when OS 10 was available and have not regretted the decision in any way
Just sayin ...... 1
Updating my Win8 to Win8.1 via Windows Store
Updating Win8.1 to Win10 by using Windows update and Win10 Reservation tool ? Will Win10 reservation option appear when i ll install all updates ( using Windows Update ) ? I would appreciate any help / advice
Thanks in advance

Google bans Huawei : they ca n't use their services
Let s say that the 90 days are over ... and Huawei comes out with their new version of Android
Could n't you just manually install Google services and the Play Store , like in Fire OS ? Or not ? I need to know what are the features that make android 9 better than the android 8 ?
If you updated your device from android 8 to android 9 what is your experience with that ?
Eventually all applications as they get updated would stop working if your phone has an out of date version of Android
May take more than a year , but it can happen

I m in the process of buying a new phone and have so far narrowed my selection to last years Huawei Mate 20 pro and this years Huawei P30 ( not the pro version )

I would appreciate any advice or discussion

I currently have an S5 , with SOME of my music , photos and even some apps on an SD card ( a necessity with only 16 G on the old phone ) , Anyone help with the best way to transfer all this to the new G9 + with Samsung Smart Switch without screwing it up or , even worse , losing some of it in the process ? I understand it will transfer from the old phone SD card , but will it put all the info on the new phone itself , or should a new SD be inserted into the new phone and it will transfer there ? This is what I wound up doing .... Took SD card out of old phone and inserted into new phone ( with the power off )
Turned on new phone .... let it do its thing ... used the Smart Switch to transfer from old phone to new .... it worked perfectly ( with the music , pics , etc ... staying on the card , where they were )
The only problem I found was a few of the contact info was a bit screwed up , but easy to fix
I m needing to replace my spouses Samsung Galaxy mega
I need a little advise on which G7 to purchase
The G7 verses the G7 power there would n't be games played on it nor would it be used for like utube like myself this is going to be more business oriented and phone calling / emails to text I needed some good advice for the purchase I found out the play is a gaming device which I have the g6 play and I was told for my useage the G7 would be a up grade and more to my liking so a little help with the better half device would be very greatly appreciated from someone who s more phone oriented than me
I was leaning towards the power g7 because of that battery life for one thing and the spouse is n't that easy at times with a take easy on like a phone ha ha she s kinda do n't worry about that stuff and I like the gorilla Glass just because that s something would help
The camera she would n't miss and utube and gaming she does n't do I just need a little help they did n't have all stuff available today like when I was kid so it s a little challenging ha ha I really appreciate your advice Since this issue has been discussed for over a decade and the priors do n't work for you is the answer " No
" ? The most common reason for folk to tell me it s slow is they have a HDD in the PC
